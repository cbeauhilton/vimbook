This repository has the contents of the 2021-2022 Vanderbilt Internal Medicine Handbook,
scraped from the website, so I can have working search and experiment with different rendering engines.

Below are some notes for my own use.

# VA notes

## orders of much consternation

- Coombs/DAT: (not in Lab Tests...) Blood Bank Orders (VBECS) -> Blood Bank Orders -> Diagnostic Tests -> Direct Antiglobulin Test
- topical TXA: Meds: Inpatient ->  tranexamic acid inj -> the option that says \*VL\*, also specify topical in the comments (thanks inpt pharm!)
- procedure service: not available at the VA
