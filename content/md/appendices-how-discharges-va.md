# "How to" on Discharges at VA
 
Complete the following steps *in this order* to ensure info will be
accurately reflected on the DIPN.

-   Medication reconciliation
    -   The list of outpatient medications at the end of your
        reconciliation is the final medication discharge list.
    -   In the medication tab, transfer new inpatient medications to the
        outpatient medication list by right-clicking and select
        ‘Transfer’
    -   Select “Pick up at window,” as this will ensure the patient will
        have the medication prior to leaving the hospital
    -   Review the existing outpatient medications to determine if they
        need to be continued and if the pt has an adequate supply at
        home - refill meds if necessary
    -   Discontinue any outpatient medications that you do not want the
        pt to continue taking. Right-click and select ‘Discontinue’

​​​​​ **Return to clinic (Primary care)**

-   -   Look at the pt banner to determine where he/she receives primary
        care (top of screen)
    -   PCC codes should start with a location (ex. NA, MU, CA etc)
        followed by the MD and number which designates the proper
        primary care physician
    -   Place an order for ‘Return to clinic’ with the appropriate
        physician and be sure to select the date of follow-up
    -   PCP, consultants, and office coordinators (RNs) can be cc’d to
        DC summary by resident

**Complete DIPN**

-   The DIPN contains all of the discharge instructions
-   Start a new note and select ‘DIPN’ template. This will open a
    pre-templated note - follow the prompts and select finish. All
    sections need to be addressed to proceed.
-   Discharge related orders will generate after you finish the DIPN
    prompts, which includes vaccinations, removing IV, removing Foley
    catheter, etc.
-   The DIPN is valid for 24 hrs; thus the DIPN may be pre-signed one
    day prior. If DIPN is pre-signed, final changes to pt instructions
    and medications need to be addended.

**Sign the DFF (discharge from facility) order**

-   The DFF order is found under the “Discharge Orders” tab in CPRS
    orders
-   Once all steps are completed, DFF can be signed and pt will be
    discharged from facility
