Wound Staging adapted from Dr. Duggan's Geriatrics Guide

Wound Care by Amanda Bailey, NP

-   Document ALL wounds that are present on admission. This affects
    reimbursement.
-   Use the Haiku app on your cellphone to document images of wounds in
    pt chart

Recall other types of ulcers to consider in your differential:

-   Arterial
    : shallow, well-defined borders, pale/necrotic wound bed, minimal
    exudate due to poor blood flow, cramping pain or a constant deep
    ache
-   Diabetic
    : Plantar surface of foot, callused wound margins; usually painless
    due to neuropathy
-   Venous
    : medial malleolus, irregular edges, ruddy red with yellow slough
    and copious exudate

Non Acute Wound

-   Order “Inpatient Consult to Adult **Simple** Wound Ostomy VUH” for:
    -   Pressure Injuries – stage 1, stage 2, deep tissue injury
    -   Skin tears – partial thickness
    -   Moisture Associated Skin Damage – diarrhea, tube drainage, skin
        folds
    -   Partial thickness wounds – other
    -   Peri-tube skin problems – peg, trach skin issues
    -   Fistulas
-   Order “Inpatient Consult to **Complex** Wound” for:
    -   Pressure injuries – stage 3, 4, unstageable
    -   Wounds with pathology
        -   Diabetic – areas of pressure
            -   For routine diabetic foot wounds even if they need
                debridement but are not frankly infected, consult
                COMPLEX WOUND
            -   Caveat
                : If frank pus or erythema is spreading up leg, consult
                “Ortho foot-ankle”
            -   Caveat
                : If pt is being followed by Drs. Hicks, Trenner or
                Deeter, consult “Ortho Foot-Ankle.” Use the Epic search
                tool to determine this
    -   Arterial – distal on digit
    -   Venous – gravity dependent areas
    -   Calciphylaxis
    -   Pyoderma Gangrenosum
    -   Fungating Lesion
    -   Vasculitis
    -   Abscess ( ***already*** drained, just needs packing
        instructions)
    -   Surgical wounds (for pts ***without*** VUMC surgeon)
    -   If pt has VUMC surgeon, consult appropriate surgical team (see
        below)
    -   Hematoma with no active bleeding but with overlying skin
        necrosis/wound
    -   Wound with underlying osteomyelitis
    -   IV infiltrate –contact team pharmacist or inpatient pharmacy
        (615-875-6337) for protocol

-   Wound VAC present
    -   Vanderbilt surgeon – consult Vanderbilt provider to provide care
        -   Ensure connected to VUMC wound VAC. Pt shouldn’t use home
            unit while admitted
        -   Order “nursing communication” to “Obtain wound VAC hospital
            machine and canister from service center to connect pt to
            hospital machine.”
        -   Wound VAC should not be left without suction for more than 2
            hours
        -   Settings: 125 mmHg continuous
    -   Non VUMC surgeon (i.e., gets wound care at outside
        hospital/wound care center)
        -   Discontinue wound VAC as soon as possible
        -   Remove all of the clear plastic drape just like you would
            remove tape
        -   Remove all of the sponge just like you would remove gauze
            packing
        -   Examine the wound to ensure no residual sponge by gently
            probing site
        -   Rinse with saline, initiate care based wound type as above
-   Leg Wrap present (i.e., Unna’s boot, ACE and 2, 3, or 4 layer
    compression)
    -   Remove by cutting the wrap off
    -   Assess the wound and order dressing based on type of wound as
        above
    -   Order ACE bandage wrapped toe-to-knee. Remove q12h to assess
        skin
-   Debridement Needed
    -   Complex wound care can provide non-urgent/non-emergent bedside
        debridement
    -   The presence of necrotic, odorous, black, grey, yellow or loose
        dead debris does not require emergent or urgent debridement by a
        surgical service and in most cases can be managed with dressings
        described above until wound consult team can assess pt
