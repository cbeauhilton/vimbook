# Arrhythmias
 
Acute Management of Arrhythmias - Mark Sonderman

-   Have RN prepare 12-lead EKG while walking to room, and place defib
    pads on patient
-   Is the patient unstable (hypotensive, signs/symptoms of
    hypoperfusion)?
-   Is the information real?
    -   Review tele strips if stable: VUMC Web Resources
        à
        VUH PIICiX Philips Web
        à
        patient selection
        à
        alarm review (vuhphilipsweb.app.vumc.org)
    -   Review past EKGs to determine if patient has had this rhythm
        before
-   IV access?
-   Draw labs: BMP, Mg, TSH, and +/- troponin, tox screen

Bradyarrhythmia

Causes

-   Sinus bradycardia, Sick Sinus Syndrome
    -   Consider underlying etiology and treat appropriately
    -   Sepsis/hypoxia/vagal tone/ overmedication (beta-blockers,
        non-DHP CCB)
    -   Unlikely to cause symptoms if HR > 50
-   AV Block
    -   First degree: PR interval >200 ms
    -   Second degree AV block (Mobitz I): progressively prolonging PR
        followed by non-conducted P wave
    -   Second degree AV block (Mobitz II): dropped beats without
        prolonging PR
    -   Third degree AV block (complete heart block): no association
        between P and QRS

Management

-   Avoid nodal blocking agents
-   Consider reversible causes of new heart block –acute MI (especially
    inferior), metabolic derangement (especially hyperkalemia),
    endocarditis with abscess, medication related
-   In Mobitz II or Complete heart block, EP consult for pacemaker
    evaluation
-   If unstable, General Schema for symptomatic (hypotensive)
    bradycardia:

Atropine (0.5 mg every 3 to 5 minutes; maximum total dose: 3 mg)

Dopamine (2 to 20 mcg/kg/minute)

Transvenous pacing

&

(Pacer pads on the defib device are capable of pacing, but don’t forget
to sedate!)

Tachyarrhythmia - Narrow complex

-   For any unstable tachyarrhythmia, start with treatment (synchronized
    cardioversion or ACLS) and determine type later; Consider 0.5-2 mg
    IV midazolam for sedation
-   Place defibrillator pads, prepare for synchronized cardioversion at
    200 J (can
    ↑
    300-360 J)

Management

-   Sinus tachycardia
    -   Address underlying causes: fever/sepsis, hypo/hypervolemia,
        anxiety, anemia, PE, ACS, hypoxia, pain, urinary retention,
        withdrawal  
-   Atrial Fibrillation/Flutter – See AFib section for complete
    details  
-   AVNRT/Orthodromic AVRT
    -   Vagal maneuvers are first line
        -   Pt sits upright, give pt 10cc syringe and have them blow
            into tip for 10-15 sec, once they are done, have them
            rapidly lay supine and raise legs
    -   Adenosine
        -   Therapeutic to break AVRT/AVNRT **and** diagnostic, as it
            causes transient AV block that may allow visualization of
            atrial tachycardia or flutter
        -   Do NOT give with Heart transplant, severe COPD,
            pre-excitation causing wide complex tachycardia (WPW
            à
            antidromic AVRT)
        -   Warn pt, he or she will transiently feel terrible
            -   6mg x1
                à
                6mg x1 (if not effective after 1-2 min)
                à
                12mg x1 (if refractory to 6mg)
            -   Given peripherally at AC site or above w/ arm elevated
                then flush rapidly
            -   If giving centrally, cut dose in half: 3mg x1
                à
                3mg x1
                à
                6mg  
-   Multifocal atrial tachycardia: irregularly irregular, <u>\></u> 3 p
    wave morphologies/PR intervals
    -   Seen in pulmonary and cardiac disease
    -   Does not cause hemodynamic instability
    -   BBs and non-DHP CCBs can be effective, need to address
        underlying issue
