# Bedside Echocardiography
 
Bedside Echocardiography – Jamie Pfaff

Finding an Ultrasound

-   MICU: radiology room behind charge nurse’s desk in middle hallway
-   VA ICU: In front of resident workspace
-   8N: Behind nurses station before entering cleaning supply room
-   8S: in the supply closet to left of the nurses station (code is
    1-3-5)
-   6MCE: Middle hallway by service center, ask nursing for sign-out
-   CCU/5N only: supply room on left as entering CCU
-   Round wing: 5th floor, ask nurses

Parasternal long:

Anatomy: RV, LA, MV, LV, AV, Aortic outflow tract

-   Probe position: Start with indicator of probe pointing toward
    patient’s right shoulder (\~10 o’ clock), midclavicular in 2
    <sup>nd</sup> - 3 <sup>rd</sup> intercostal space
-   Make sure probe is centered over mitral valve **(Should see MV and
    AV)**

Quick EF estimation

-> E-Point Septal Separation (EPSS):

distance separating the anterior MV leaflet from the septal wall as
measure of LV systolic function

-   -   

-   Place M mode spike at tip of mitral leaflet and hit M mode
    (perpendicular to septum)

-   Identify E point (passive filling of LV) and determine distance from
    interventricular septum
    -   \<7mm = Normal
    -   \>10mm = Reduced EF

-   Confounders that elevate EPSS: AR, MS

-   Probe position: Rotate probe 180 degrees with right edge of
    probe/probe marker pointing toward patient’s left shoulder

Apical four chamber

:  Anatomy: RA, RV, LA, LV

-   Probe position: Slide down and look near patient’s left nipple (or
    in the intermammary fold after lifting up breast tissue if needed)
    (At PMI if can find)

Subxiphoid

:  Anatomy: RA, RV, LA, LV

-   Probe position: Push probe head into patient’s abdomen just below
    xiphoid and flatten probe to make nearly parallel to patient’s
    position
-   Troubleshooting: shift probe slightly left of midline (toward
    patient’s right) and angle toward heart/right to use liver as
    acoustic window or ask patient to take big breath (moves heart
    closer to probe)

IVC

-   Probe position: subxiphoid area with probe marker facing toward
    patient’s head slightly left of midline, trace IVC into RA to verify
    correct vessel (center on RA, then rotate 90°)
-   IVC Size and collapsibility used as surrogate for CVP and RAP
    -   \< 2.1 cm in size, > 50% collapsible: RAP \~3 mmHg
    -   \< 2.1cm in size, \< 50% collapsible **OR** IVC > 2.1 cm, > 50%
        collapsible: RAP \~8 mmHg
    -   \>2.1 cm in size, \< 50% collapsible: RAP > 15 mmHg
