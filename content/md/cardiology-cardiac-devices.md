Cardiac Devices - Mark Sonderman

-   Permanent Pacemaker
    -   A
        battery that provides electrical current to 1 or 2 leads (RA
        and/or RV) which stimulates the myocardium when the innate
        electrical activity of the heart is insufficient
    -   Indications (typically requires symptoms):
        -   -   Sinus Node Dysfunction
            -   AV node dysfunction (2 <sup>nd</sup> Degree Type II with
                sx or Type 3 block, carotid sinus hypersensitivity,
                after catheter ablation of AV node for AF)
            -   Bifascicular or alternating L and RBBB
-   ICD
    -   RV Lead (can also be epicardial) that contains a coil for
        defibrillation in case of VF or VT; additionally performs ATP
        (anti-tachycardia pacing) to ideally prevent a shock
    -   Indications:
        -   -   Primary Prevention: In general, think about those at
                risk for sudden cardiac death.
                -   CHF with EF \<35%and NYHA II-III on max GDMT
                -   LVEF \<30% and post-MI >40d
                -   Consider Brugada, ARVC, HCM, sarcoid, Long QT,
                    congenital disease (SCD)
            -   Secondary Prevention: Survivors of VF arrest, unstable
                VT w/o reversible cause, and structural heart disease
                with history of sustained VT

-   CRT
    -   3 Lead Pacemaker (RA, RV, coronary sinus to LV) that coordinates
        LV/RV contraction through synchronized activation of each
        ventricle
    -   Patients with HFrEF and ventricular conduction delay (prolonged
        QRS) are at highest risk for HF progression and this aims to
        reverse it.
    -   Indications:
        -   -   Class I: EF\<35%, NYHA II- IV ambulatory, on GDMT, NSR
                with LBBB and QRS
                ≥

                150
            -   Class IIa: Above criteria with minor differences (LBBB &
                QRS 120-149, non-LBBB and QRS
                ≥

                150\) OR EF\<35% and expected to require >40%
                ventricular pacing

| A: atrial, V: ventricular, D: dual, O: none, I: inhibition, R: rate-adaptive | Chamber Paced | Chamber Sensed | Response to Sensed Beat | Program Features |

Examples of Common Pacing Modes:

-   VVI: Single RV lead that delivers a beat if no beat sensed. Often
    used with chronic AF with bradycardia
-   DDDR:  Senses and paces both the atria and ventricle. If beat not
    sensed within a predefined interval, beat delivered. R indicates
    rate responsivity (changes rate based on changes in patient
    activity)
-   Magnet: Paces at a fixed rate without respect to native electrical
    activity (AOO,VOO,DOO). Deactivates ICD shock. Often used in surgery
    or at end of life to avoid ICD shocks

Additional Information

-   The Pacemaker ID app is free and is useful for identifying device
    brand for interrogation
