# Chest Pain
 
Approach to Chest Pain - Nick King

Typical Chest Pain / Angina

-   Substernal Chest pain which is provoked by exertion/stress, relieved
    by rest or nitro

<!-- -->

-   -   Typical = 3/3
    -   Atypical = 2/3
    -   Non-cardiac = 0/3

<!-- -->

-   Be cautious in women and diabetics who may have atypical
    presentations of ACS

Diagnoses Not to Miss “The Serious Six”

-   Acute Coronary Syndrome
-   Aortic
    Dissection
    /Aneurysm
-   Pulmonary Embolus
-   Pneumothorax
-   Cardiac Tamponade
-   Mediastinitis (e.g, Esophageal Perforation or Rupture - Boerhaave’s
    Syndrome)

Other Differential Diagnoses

-   Skin
    : Laceration, Herpes Zoster
-   Subcutaneous: Cellulitis, Abscess
-   Musculoskeletal: Costochondritis, fracture, myositis, sprain/strain
-   Pleural space (no pain receptors in the lung): PNA, tumor, pleuritis
-   Pericardium: Pericarditis
-   Heart: Myocarditis, spontaneous coronary artery dissection (SCAD),
    coronary vasospasm, aortic stenosis, stress-induced cardiomyopathy
    (Takotsubo), decompensated heart failure
-   Esophagus: GERD, Esophagitis
-   Trachea: Tracheitis, Tracheal Tear

Physical Exam

-   Vitals: BP in both arms (do while interviewing - quick, easy,
    inexpensive)
-   Hemodynamic profile (warm/dry, warm/wet, cold/dry, cold/wet)
-   Palpate chest: evaluate costochondral junction, subcutaneous
    emphysema, examine skin
-   Cardiac: murmurs, rub for pericarditis, JVD for heart failure or PE
    with RV strain
-   Pulm: absent breath sounds for PTX, crackles for left heart failure,
    PNA
-   Abdomen: abdominal pain mistaken or referred as chest pain
-   Extremities: asymmetric leg swelling (>2 cm difference) for DVT/PE

Diagnostic Studies

-   EKG
    –ACS (STEMI, new LBBB, NSTEMI, Wellen’s sign), pericarditis,
    pericardial effusion
-   Troponin
    – ACS, PE (w/ R heart strain), myocarditis
-   CXR
    – PTX, PNA, dissection, esophageal rupture
-   Bedside Ultrasound
    – pericardial effusion, R heart strain for PE, wall motion
    abnormality for infarct/ischemia or stress-induced CM, valvular
    disease, lung sliding/PTX
-   CT-A
    – gold standard for PE (consider V/Q if unable to obtain and
    otherwise healthy lungs); Dissection can be diagnosed w/ CT-A, MR-A,
    or TEE
-   Additional Labs:
    CBC/BNP/lactate/ABG or VBG

    -specific point: a pt with chest pain + positive troponin is
    admitted to the CCU, so make sure to talk to the ED Attending/NOD
    prior to admitting a pt like this to the floor
