# Post-Cardiac Catheterization Care
 
Post-Cardiac Catheterization Care – Nick Pietrini

Catheterization Documentation

-   The most appropriate guidance for post-cath care in the cardiac
    catheterization report
-   VUMC: Epic
    
    Cardiac tab
    
    Cardiac Catheterization/Intervention Report
-   VA:  Note tab
    
    Post-Procedure note and Cardiac Catheterization note
-   If there is a delay in filing the final report at VUMC: Review the
    Cardiac Catheterization Nursing Documentation, which shows if stents
    were deployed

Post-Catheterization Heparin

-   Medical management (ie no intervention):  continue heparin gtt (or
    lovenox) for 48 hours
-   PCI: stop heparin and continue/start DAPT as directed by cardiology
-   Left main, proximal LAD, or other indication for CABG: Continue
    heparin gtt until surgery
    -   -   -   

    -   Separate medical indication for anticoagulation (DVT/PE, atrial
        fibrillation):  restart \~ six hours after catheterization

Cath Site Checks:

-   6- 8 hours post catheterization, only needed for femoral arterial
    access:
-   Look, listen, feel:
    evaluate for hematoma & pseudoaneurysm; call fellow if concerned
    -   -   -   

    -   Small amount of bruising and mild tenderness at the site is
        normal

    -   Listen above and below the site for a bruit; the area should be
        soft
-   Hypotension after femoral access: STAT CT AP & call the cardiology
    fellow for RP bleed
-   Femoral oozing: Cardiology fellow, will need to hold pressure
-   Radial oozing: instruct nurse to re-inflate the TR band and restart
    the clock on deflation
