Pulmonary artery catheters (PACs) are an invasive measurement of
hemodynamic parameters within the heart using multiple lumens and a
balloon tip to assist with placement

The following measures can be directly obtained from a PAC:

-   Central venous pressure (CVP): Pressure in vena cava, often an
    indicator of volume status
-   Right atrial pressure (RAP): Measure of volume status/RV preload
-   Right ventricular pressure (Systolic, end-diastolic): surrogate for
    PA pressure and preload
-   Pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP; systolic, diastolic, and mean):
    diagnosing pHTN
-   Pulmonary artery wedge pressure (PAWP; a-wave, v-wave, and mean):
    Wedging PAC into a small pulmonary arterial branch
    -   Surrogate for LAP and LVEDP (preload)
-   Cardiac output, thermodilution (COt, L/min): Room temperate saline
    bolus is injected via proximal PAC lumen and the temperature drop is
    measured by thermistor on the PAC tip
-   Mixed venous oxyhemoglobin saturation (SvO2): % of O2 bound to
    hemoglobin in blood returning to the right side of the heart
    -   Measurement of total body O2 extraction

A PAC can be used to calculate the following:

-   Systemic vascular resistance (SVR = 80 x \[MAP-CVP\]/ CO, in dynes
    ⋅
    sec
    ⋅
    cm-5):  differentiation of types of shock, guides titration of
    afterload-reducing therapy in HFrEF
-   Transpulmonary gradient (TPG = mean PAP - PAWP, in mm Hg):  measure
    of pre-capillary contribution in pulmonary hypertension due to left
    heart disease
-   Pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR = \[TPG\]/ CO, in Wood units = mm
    Hg/L/min, customary unit. Multiply by 80 to convert to dynes
    ⋅
    sec
    ⋅
    cm-5): Gold standard for estimation of the severity of pre-capillary
    pulmonary HTN
-   Cardiac output, Fick equation (COf, in L/min): VO2/ \[(SaO2 - SvO2)
    x Hb x 13.4)\]. VO2 is oxygen consumption, generally assumed value
    based on patient size and age
-   Cardiac index (CI = CO/body surface area, in L/min/m2)

Important equations:

heart disease

cm-5): Gold standard for estimation of the severity of pre-capillary
pulmonary HTN as well as to determine a patient’s possible candidacy for
heart transplant in left heart failure (goal for PVR \<3)

-    Cardiac output, Fick equation (COf, in L/min): VO2/ \[(SaO2 - SvO2)
x Hb x 13.4)\]. VO2 is oxygen consumption, generally assumed value based
on patient size and age; SaO2 measured via pulse oximetry or ABG; SvO2
measured as above

-    Cardiac index (CI = CO/body surface area, in L/min/m2)

Complications of pulmonary artery catheters include:

-   Arrhythmias: sustained VT, RBBB (3rd degree AV block if patient has
    a pre-existing LBBB)
-   Myocardial, vessel, or valve rupture
-   Pulmonary artery perforation
-   Pulmonary infarction, Thromboembolism
-   Infection, particularly endocarditis of the pulmonary valve
-   Venous air embolisms
