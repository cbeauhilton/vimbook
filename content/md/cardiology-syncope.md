# Syncope
 
Syncope – Eric Hall

Background

-   Transient loss of consciousness (TLOC) from cerebral hypoperfusion

-   Pre-syncope should be addressed in the same way as syncope

-   Pathogenesis:

-   -   -   

    -   Reflex/vasovagal \~20-60%: identifiable triggers such as
        shaving, straining/pooping, usually in older patients

    -   Orthostatic hypotension \~10%: more common with older patients,
        with anti-HTN meds, diuretics, H&N cancer tx, DM, Parkinson’s,
        MSA, adrenal insufficiency

    -   Neurogenic: Consider CVA, TIA, seizure and rarely subclavian
        steal syndrome

    -   Cardiovascular:
        -   Mechanical/structural, including aortic stenosis or other
            valvular disease, HCM, PE, pHTN, ischemia, tamponade
        -   Arrhythmia, including block, pauses, WPW, long/short QT as
            evidence of arrhythmia-mediated syncope

    -   Alternate diagnoses: metabolic, intoxication, iatrogenic or
        medication effect, concussion, and episodes that are not true
        TLOC (cataplexy, psychogenic)

Evaluation

-   CBC, CMP, EKG, telemetry, troponin, BNP if concerned for cardiac
    etiology, POC blood glucose, UDS, orthostatic vitals
-   Consider (depending on patient’s history): TTE, head imaging, 2-hour
    EEG (get neuro involved early if concerned for neurologic etiology),
    TSH + cortisol (random vs AM), infectious workup, stress testing for
    exertional syncope

Management

-   Dependent on cause (see other sections)
-   If presumed diagnosis is autonomic dysfunction, consider consult at
    VA & VUMC to Autonomics for consideration of oral vasopressor
    (midodrine, droxidopa), compression stockings, abdominal binder,
    follow-up, etc
-   On discharge (depending on evaluation/presumed diagnosis) consider
    also cardiac event monitoring, ambulatory blood pressure monitoring,
    +/- tilt table testing
-   Driving
    (TN Driver Improvement, Rule 1340-01-04-.06):
    -   TN law does not require any MD to inform the state of TLOC
    -   If notified, the state may suspend/decline to re-issue the pt's
        driver’s license for 6-12 months (if underlying condition
        controlled, pt is free of TLOC, and the state receives a
        “favorable medical report” from an MD)
    -   Make sure to document all conversations about driving that you
        have with pts
