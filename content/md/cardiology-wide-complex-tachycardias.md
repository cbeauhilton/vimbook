-   Ask yourself, is this Ventricular Tachycardia (VT) or is it SVT with
    Aberrant conduction
    -   Aberrant conduction: supraventricular impulse whose QRS is > 110
        ms and may resemble a BBB (right bundle more likely to be
        refractory)

Evaluation

-   BMP, Mg lvl, troponin (if concerned for ischemia)
-   Quick and Accurate: AVR criteria
-   Ventricular Tachycardia is always regular (RR interval):
    **irregular** = AF with aberrancy
-   ECG features which increase likelihood of VT
    -   Positive or negative concordance = lack of R wave progression on
        Precordial leads
    -   Very broad complexes >160 ms
    -   AV dissociation
        -   Capture Beats: native QRS complexes making a cameo during
            the VT
        -   Fusion Beats: QRS which appear like a signal average of VT
            and native complex
    -   RsR’ complex with a taller left rabbit ear
    -   Absence of typical BBB morphologies

Management

-   Unstable = SHOCK
    -   Midazolam: draw 2 mg (comes in 2 mg vials), give 1 mg (have more
        available)
    -   Synchronized 100 J Biphasic if VT
    -   Defibrillation if VF
    -   Pacer Pads, talk to cards fellow, start medical work-up (labs,
        imaging, EKG, etc)
-   Stable
    -   Medications
        -   Acute antiarrhythmics: amiodarone, lidocaine, procainamide
    -   Cardioversion
    -   Treatment of underlying cause if identifiable
        -   Ischemia, electrolyte disturbances, heart failure, drugs
-   Chronic
    -   Medications: beta-blockers, amiodarone, mexiletine, sotalol
    -   Radiofrequency ablation
    -   ICD

Additional

information

-   Definitions of Ventricular Arrhythmias
    -   Premature Ventricular Complex (PVC): early ventricular
        depolarization +/- mechanical contraction
        -   -   PVC burden:  % of beats of ventricular origin / total
                beats over a  24- hour period
    -   Sustained VT: continuous VT for 30 seconds, or shorter if it
        requires an intervention for termination
    -   VT storm: three or more separate episodes of sustained VT within
        24 hours
-   VT Morphologies
    -   Monomorphic VT: a similar QRS configuration from beat to beat
        -   -   Usually, 2/2 scar medicated VT from prior infarction
    -   Polymorphic VT: a continuously changing QRS configuration from
        beat to beat
        -   -   Ischemia until proven otherwise
    -   Torsades de Pointes: a form of polymorphic VT with a continually
        varying QRS that appears to spiral around the baseline of the
        ECG in a sinusoidal pattern
        -   -   SHORT – LONG – SHORT = refers to the R-R interval
                activation sequence
            -   PVC (Short) followed by compensatory pause (Long) ->
                results in heterogenous repolarization -> PVC ( R on T
                phenomena) -> VT
    -   VF: chaotic rhythm characterized by undulations that are
        irregular in timing and morphology, without discrete QRS
        complexes

Premature Ventricular Complexes (PVCs)

Background

-   PVCs are common: Up to 80% of apparently healthy people have PVCs
    -   Normal number of PVCs in an adult is \<500 in 24 hrs
-   Causes
    -   Re-entry: patient with structural heart disease like in post
        infarction (scars)
    -   Abnormal Automaticity: electrolyte abnormalities or acute
        ischemia (Purkinje fibers)
    -   Triggered Activity: early and late after depolarizations which
        occur because of Hypokalemia, ischemia, infracts, excess calcium
        and drug toxicity
-   Etiologies
    -   HTN with LVH, HF, myocarditis, ARVC, HCM, idiopathic VT, OSA,
        pHTN, COPD, thyroid disease, substance use (EtOH, nicotine,
        stimulants, caffeine)

Work Up

-   Inpatient Evaluation:
    -   12 lead EKG: conduction disease, long QT syndrome, Brugada
        syndrome, ARVC
    -   Labs: K and Mg, TSH, drug screen
    -   Evaluate Burden on Tele
    -   Evaluate for QT prolonging agents: Longer QT // risk of
        Torsades  
-   Outpatient Evaluation:
    -   12 Lead EKG
    -   Labs: BMP, CBC, TSH, Drug screen, BNP if c/f congestion, Dig
        level if applicable
    -   If exertional symptoms: exercise treadmill testing
    -   Ambulatory Heart Monitoring to evaluate burden

Management

-   Treat correctable causes discovered on laboratory testing
-   First line therapy for distressing, symptomatic PVCs = beta blockers
    -   Diltiazem is a reasonable consideration although avoid in CHF
        patients
-   Patients with 10% or higher PVC burden should be evaluated by
    echocardiography due to development of PVC induced cardiomyopathy
    and benefit from catheter ablation
