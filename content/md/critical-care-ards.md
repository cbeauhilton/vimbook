| Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) – Judd Heideman |

Background

-   A syndrome of diffuse inflammation and injury of the alveoli and
    capillary endothelium leading to fluid and protein accumulation in
    the interstitium and alveoli, pulmonary edema, and hypoxemic
    respiratory failure; 30-50% mortality rate
-   Triggers:
    -   Pulmonary
        -   Pneumonia (viral and bacterial)
        -   Aspiration
        -   Direct inhalation injury
        -   Primary graft dysfunction of pulmonary transplant
        -   Lung contusion
    -   Extra-pulmonary
        -   ​​​​​
            Sepsis (most common cause)
        -   Trauma
        -   Pancreatitis
        -   Massive blood transfusions/TRALI
        -   Burns
        -   HSCT
        -   Drugs (amiodarone, chemotherapy, cocaine, opioids)

Evaluation

-   Diagnosis: Berlin Criteria
    -   New or worsening respiratory symptoms beginning within one week
        of diagnosis

    -   New bilateral opacities present on chest radiograph or CT chest

    -   -   Not explained by effusions, collapse of lobe/lung, or
            nodules

-   -   Absence of left heart failure or volume overload

-   Severity: based on PaO2/FiO2 ratio with a PEEP ≥ 5 cm H2O
    -   PaO2 = arterial partial pressure of O2 (requires ABG)
    -   FiO2 = fraction of inspired oxygen (expressed as a decimal
        between 0.21 and 1.0)

| 0        | 1               | 2    |
|----------|-----------------|------|
| NaN      | PaO2/FiO2 ratio | PEEP |
| Mild     | 201-300         | ≥5   |
| Moderate | 101-200         | ≥5   |
| Severe   | \<100           | ≥5   |

Management

-   Frequently requires intubation; non-invasive ventilation not a great
    treatment
-   Low tidal volume (Vt) ventilation
    -   Goal **Vt = 4-8 mL/kg** of **predicted** body weight (obese pts
        don’t have bigger lungs)
    -   Predicted body weight is based on **height** and gender of pt
        -   -   Males = 50 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)
            -   Females = 45.5 + 2.3 (height in inches – 60)

<!-- -->

-   Plateau pressure goal: ≤30 cm H2O
-   Oxygenation goal: PaO2 55-80 or SpO2 88-95%
-   pH goal: ≥7.20, “permissive hypercapnia”
-   Treat the underlying cause (see “Triggers” above)
-   See below for further management of refractory hypoxemia

At VUMC:

-   To find FiO2, go to Summary tab > Flowsheet, look under “Resp
    support”
-   To order ABGs, search “resp care” and click on “Adult Respiratory
    Lab Panel (aka Respiratory care)” > arterial blood gas labs > Blood
    gas arterial
    -   RT labs performed much faster in the MICU than on the floor
    -   Consider A-line if checking 2 or more times/day
