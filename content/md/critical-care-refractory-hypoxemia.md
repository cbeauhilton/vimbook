Background

-   Inadequate arterial oxygenation despite high levels of inspired O2
    or the development of barotrauma in mechanically ventilated pts
-   Generally start to consider the interventions below if needing
    FiO2 >80%
-   Differential:
    -   Worsening underlying primary process (e.g. progressive ARDS)
    -   PE
    -   Pneumothorax
    -   ET tube obstruction/malposition
    -   Fluid overload
    -   Ventilator-associated Pneumonia
    -   New ARDS

Evaluation:

-   Always get CXR STAT if pt has new or worsening O2 requirement
-   ABG is frequently very helpful as well
-   Can use POCUS to check for lung sliding (pneumothorax) or RV
    enlargement/septal bowing/McConnell’s sign (RV strain in PE)

Management

-   Remember – if at any point the pt is rapidly decompensating, you can
    always disconnect them from the vent and bag them until they
    recover/while calling for help

-   Early consideration of ECMO consult in appropriate pts (discuss with
    MICU fellow)
    -   After talking with the fellow/attending, you can start process
        by placing “Inpatient consult to ECMO adult” in Epic

-   Optimize fluid status
    
    consider diuresis/dialysis if not making urine

-   Consider higher PEEP strategy
    -   Increased PEEP
        
        higher mean airway pressure, generally improves oxygenation
        especially with diffuse pulmonary pathologies
        -   -   Exceptions may include certain focal/shunt pathologies
                (e.g. dense lobar PNA)
            -   Worsening oxygenation may occur with overdistension of
                alveoli
                
                increase dead space ventilation; generally determined
                empirically at the bedside

-   -   Titrate up slowly; generally do not exceed PEEP 18
        -   -   Limited by high plateau pressures/barotrauma,
                overdistension/dead space ventilation, decreased
                preload/venous return
    -   ARDSnet FiO2/PEEP Tables: We usually use the Lower PEEP table

-   Other recruitment maneuvers
    -   Reposition pt – can try elevating HOB or positioning so “good
        lung” is down
    -   If concern for mucus plug, consider need for bronch
    -   If concern for significant atelectasis can try recruitment
        maneuvers with the vent including sustained inflation (setting
        expiratory pressure to \~30 for \~30 seconds) and PEEP titration
        (setting PEEP to 20-25 and decreasing by 2cm at a time) – **call
        the fellow before attempting**

Management Algorithm:

1.  Inhaled vasodilators

-   VUMC formulary preference: inhaled epoprostenol (aka Flolan)
-   Alternatives: inhaled milrinone, inhaled nitric oxide
-   Data suggest improved PaO2/FiO2; large RCT without evidence for
    mortality benefit

2.  Deep sedation (RASS -4 or -5)

-   Promotes ventilator synchrony

3.  Neuromuscular blockade (paralysis) – call your fellow before doing
this

-   Rationale: maximal vent synchrony (eliminates residual chest
    wall/diaphragm tone)
-   Pt MUST be RASS -5 (need analgesia + sedation, cannot achieve with
    dexmedetomidine alone, which does not have amnestic properties)
-   Trial one time IV push of vecuronium 0.1 mg/kg
-   If improved vent synchrony/oxygenation, consider cisatracurium
    (Nimbex) drip
-   Data are mixed
    
    ACURASYS 2010 (improved 90-day mortality but underpowered likely
    overestimating benefit); ROSE 2019 (no difference in 90-day
    mortality)

4.  Prone positioning (Need attending approval)

-   Pts with moderate to severe ARDS (PaO2/FiO2 ratio \< 150)
-   At VUMC, we use regular ICU beds and manually flip pts; cycle prone
    16 hrs/supine 8 hrs
-   When proning or supining a pt, always have a provider who can
    intubate in the room in case unplanned extubation occurs (anesthesia
    or pulm attending)
-   Considerations: need a team of people to reposition, high risk of ET
    tube malposition, difficult to access lines/perform procedures, high
    risk of pressure injuries
-   Data: PROSEVA 2013
    
    proning improved 28-day mortality; study complicated by imbalances
    between groups

5.  Alternative ventilator modes (usually Pressure Control or
APRV/BiLevel/BiVent)

-   Always ask for help from a fellow or attending before switching to a
    mode that you do not know how to trouble shoot!
-   APRV/BiVent should be avoided in people with bad obstructive lung
    disease, hemodynamic instability, refractory hypercarbia

6.  Venovenous (V-V) ECMO

-   Indications for hypoxemia:
    -   PaO2/FiO2 \< 50 with FiO2 >80% for >3 hrs OR
    -   PaO2/FiO2 \< 80 with FiO2 >80% for >6 hrs AND
    -   Mechanical ventilation ≤ 1 week
-   Absolute Contraindications:
    -   Poor short-term prognosis (e.g. metastatic cancer)
    -   Irreversible, devastating neurologic pathology
    -   Chronic respiratory insufficiency without the possibility for
        transplant
-   Goal must be clear upfront
    
    bridge to recovery, transplant, or transplant decision
-   Can calculate RESP score
    
    predicts in-hospital survival with ECMO
-   CONSULT EARLY if a pt may be a candidate; does not commit pt to
    procedure but allows ECMO team to assist with evaluation
-   Data:
    -   CESAR 2009
        
        improved 6-month survival without severe disability
    -   EOLIA 2018
        
        no mortality benefit but 28% crossover from control to ECMO arm
        dilutes potential effects
