| Sepsis – Kaele Leonard |

Background

-   Sepsis-3: organ dysfunction from dysregulated host response to
    infection
-   Acute change in baseline SOFA score ≥2
-   Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) score: P/F ratio, Plts,
    Tbili, SBP, GCS, Cr
-   "Quick" SOFA (qSOFA): ≥2 of AMS (GCS≤13), SBP≤100 mmHg, RR≥22/min
-   Septic shock = sepsis + vasopressors + lactate >2 meq/dL

Evaluation

-   Cultures prior to antibiotics if possible (but don’t delay
    antibiotics just to get cultures): obtain blood Cx x2 (peripheral
    vein via venipuncture preferred), urine Cx, etc.
-   Consider sputum Cx, paracentesis, thoracentesis, wound Cx, LP, joint
    aspiration
-   Lactate (even if not hypotensive)
-   Imaging: x-ray or CT of potential source

Management

-   Source control: Remove old lines, Chest tube for empyema, Drain
    abscesses

<!-- -->

-   Early antibiotics: START EARLY—each hour of delay of antibiotics
    ↑
    mortality by \~7%
    -   Target organisms most likely to cause infection in suspected
        organ; if source unknown, start empiric broad-spectrum
    -   MRSA coverage
        
        vancomycin/daptomycin/linezolid/ceftaroline
    -   Pseudomonas coverage
        
        zosyn/cefepime/meropenem /cipro/gentamicin
    -   Pneumonia: add atypical coverage (azithromycin/levaquin; 2nd
        line doxycyline)
    -   Fungal coverage for Candida: if neutropenic, TPN, abdominal
        surgery, prior antibiotics, >1 site colonized
        
        fluconazole, micafungin for Candida glabrata ( or resistant
        strains)

<!-- -->

-   Resuscitation
    -   IV fluid: give 1-3 L (≥30 mL/kg of body weight) of IV balanced
        crystalloid
    -   Only give blood if Hb \< 7, unless evidence of bleeding, severe
        hypoxemia, or myocardial ischemia
    -   Monitor HR, BP, mental status, urine output – do NOT give
        beta-blockers to slow HR in the setting of sepsis unless
        dangerously high and limiting diastolic filling (discuss with
        fellow), this is an appropriate stress response
    -   Assess fluid responsiveness by US IVC (mixed data), pulse
        pressure, leg raise

<!-- -->

-   Vasopressors
    -   Start if MAP not responsive to fluid resuscitation
    -   Target MAP > 65mmHg, also monitor mental status, serum lactate,
        and urine output; may need higher goal with pts with chronic HTN
    -   Start with norepinephrine -- via central line, PICC, port; can
        run through peripheral IV up to 15 mcg/min for up to 48 hours
        -   -   SOAP II trial -- norepinephrine > dopamine (less
                arrhythmias)
            -   No upper limit of NE but can cause peripheral ischemia
                with prolonged use
    -   Add vasopressin at fixed dose of 0.04 units/min when NE dose >=
        50 mcg/min
        -   -   VASST trial: possible benefit for pts on 5-15 of NE;
                however, this was opposite of hypothesis and vasopressin
                is expensive
    -   Add epinephrine or dobutamine when low cardiac output
    -   Add phenylephrine for pts with tachyarrhythmias
    -   Rarely use dopamine
    -   Consider Angiotensin II (discuss with fellow, needs MICU
        leadership approval)
        
        contraindicated with CHF and DVT/PE/clots/hypercoagulability
    -   Consider steroids if vasopressors failing or on steroids
        chronically
        
        hydrocortisone 100mg IV q8hr or 50mg IV q6hr (see Endocrine
        Section)
