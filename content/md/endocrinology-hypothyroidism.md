# Hypothyroidism
 
Hypothyroidism – Griffin Bullock

Background

-   Elevated TSH and Low FT4 (primary hypothyroidism
    ):
    -   Hashimoto’s (autoimmune) thyroiditis, Iodine deficiency, drugs
        (amiodarone, dopamine antagonists), adrenal insufficiency,
        thyroid hormone resistance (genetic), non-thyroidal illness
        (recovery phase), post-surgery or ablation for hyperthyroidism
-   Elevated TSH and Normal FT4
    : subclinical hypothyroidism
-   Low-Normal TSH, Low FT4
    : central hypothyroidism, sick euthyroid

Presentation

-   Often
    non-specific and vague: Fatigue, cold intolerance, weight gain,
    constipation, dry skin, myalgia, edema menstrual irregularities,
    depression, mental dysfunction
-   Goiter, bradycardia, diastolic hypertension, delayed relaxation
    following reflex testing
-   Lab abnormalities: microcytic anemia, hypercholesterolemia,
    hyponatremia, elevated CK

Evaluation

-   TSH: If elevated repeat TSH and obtain T4
-   Lipid panel, CBC, BMP

Management

-   Required if
    ↓
    T4, significantly
    ↑
    TSH (>10), or symptoms with any lab abnormality
-   Titrate therapy to a normal TSH (unless central hypothyroidism, then
    target Free T4 levels)
-   Observation of asymptomatic pts w/ subclinical hypothyroidism
    (normal T4, mild
    ↑
    TSH)
-   Treatment is with formulation of T4 (full replacement is
    approximately 1.6 mcg/kg/day)
-   Initial Dose:
    -   Young/healthy patients: full anticipated dose
    -   Older patients or patients w CAD: 25-50 mcg daily
-   Increased doses will be required in the following:
    -   Pregnancy
    -   Estrogen therapy
    -   Weight gain ​​​​​​​
    -   PPI therapy
    -   GI disorders
        ↓
        absorption
    -   Ferrous sulfate therapy

Additional Information

-   Pts should take Levothyroxine alone, 1 hr prior to eating to ensure
    appropriate absorption
-   Of note, missed doses can be taken along with the next dose
-   Symptoms improve in 2-3 weeks. TSH steady state requires 6 weeks
-   Dose can be titrated every 6 weeks based on TSH (standard
    management)
-   Can titrate dose in 4 weeks in pregnancy, or in 2-4 weeks for
    profoundly hypothyroid pts, with titration based on Free T4 rather
    than TSH
-   Pregnancy: signs and symptoms are similar. Pregnancy causes lab
    changes due to differing levels thyroid binding globulin. Use tables
    based on trimester to interpret values
    -   TPO antibody testing should be conducted if abnormal as this
        affects risk of complications.
    -   Referral to endocrine for close monitoring and adjustment to
        avoid fetal complications
    -   Pts are at
        ↑
        risk for preeclampsia, placental abruption, preterm
        labor/delivery
