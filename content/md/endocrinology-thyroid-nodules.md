# Thyroid Nodules
 
Thyroid Nodules – Terra Swanson

Background

-   \~50% of adults will have a thyroid nodule on ultrasound
-   Benign
    : goiter, cyst, inflammatory, Hashimoto’s, follicular adenoma
    (microadenoma)
-   Malignant
    : follicular, papillary, medullary, anaplastic, metastatic, thyroid
    lymphoma
-   RF for malignancy: Age \<30 years; hx of head or neck radiation;
    family Hx of thyroid cancer

Evaluation

-   Initial work-up after a nodule is found (either clinically or
    incidentally on imaging):
    -   TSH, Free T4
    -   Thyroid US

Management

-   If Low TSH: Likely
    a hyperfunctioning nodule (benign in 95% of cases)
    -   Order Iodine-123 or technetium-99m thyroid scan
        -   If **hyperfunctioning**
            →
            measure T3/free T4 if
            ↑
            , treat for hyperthyroidism
        -   If **non-functioning**
            →
            proceed as if TSH were normal
-   Normal or elevated TSH:
    -   FNA indicated based on U/S findings listed below (determined by
        TI-RADS system)
        -   Nodules >1 cm that have high- or intermediate-suspicion
            pattern
        -   Nodules >1.5 cm that have low-suspicion pattern
        -   Nodules <u>\></u> 2 cm that have very-low-suspicion pattern
    -   FNA cytology determines the plan of action:
        -   Benign → periodic US monitoring at 12-24 months, then at
            increasing interval
        -   Indeterminate → repeat FNA in 3-12 months
        -   Malignant
            →
            surgical referral
-   Nodules that do not meet FNA criteria, US findings determine the
    timing for follow-up imaging:
    -   High suspicion: 6-12 months
    -   Low to intermediate suspicion: 12-24 months
    -   Nodules >1 cm with very
        ↓
        suspicion OR pure cyst:  >24 months if at al
-   ​​​​​​​
    Nodules <u>\<</u> 1 cm with very
    ↓
    suspicion OR pure cyst:
    no further imaging necessary
