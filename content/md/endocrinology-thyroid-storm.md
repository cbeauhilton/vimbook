# Thyroid Storm
 
Thyroid Storm – Gaby Schroeder

Background

-   Diagnosis: based on recognition of exaggerated signs/symptoms of
    thyrotoxicosis leading to multi-organ dysfunction in the setting of
    precipitating event
-   Common
    Precipitants: Grave’s Disease, Surgery, Trauma, Pregnancy, stress,
    Infection, MI/PE, medication non-compliance, iodine loads
-   Use
    Burch-Wartofsky Point Scale (BWPS); available on MD Calc
    -   \>45 highly suggestive
    -   25-44 impending storm
    -   \<25 unlikely to represent storm

Management

-   ENDOCRINE
    EMERGENCY, if suspected should get Endocrine Consult ASAP
-   Therapies directed towards thyroid gland:
    -   PTU: Preferred, 500-1000mg loading dose, followed by 250mg q4 -6
        hours (PO, rectal)
    -   Methimazole: q4-6 hours, dose varies (PO, rectal, IV)
-   Therapies directed toward decreasing T4 to T3 conversion:
    -   Propranolol (60-80mg PO q4)
    -   Hydrocortisone (300mg x1, 100mg q8)
        -   Treats high incidence of co-existing adrenal insufficiency
-   Cholestyramine 4g QID can be considered to reduce enteric
    recirculation
-   Refractory Storm: Plasmapheresis and Plasma Exchange
-   Supportive care and identify precipitating factor
-   Close hemodynamic monitoring, may need vasopressors (likely ICU)
