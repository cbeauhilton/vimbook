# Acute Diverticulitis
 
Acute Diverticulitis – Michael Koenig

Background

-   Inflammation
    and/or infection of a diverticulum, a small out-pouching along wall
    of colon
-   Ddx
    : (see approach to abdominal pain)
-   Presence of colonic flora on Urine culture suggests colo-vesical
    fistula
-   Most pts w/ uncomplicated diverticulitis have significant
    improvement 2-3 d after IV abx

Presentation

-   Lower abdominal pain (85% LLQ), tenderness to palpation on exam,
    N/V, low-grade fever, change in bowel habits (constipation or
    diarrhea)

Evaluation

-   CBC w/diff, CMP, Lipase, U/A,
    β
    \- hCG
-   Imaging
    : CT abdomen/pelvis with oral and IV contrast
    -   -   CT findings: localized bowel wall thickening (>4mm),
            paracolic fat stranding, presence of colonic diverticula

Management

-   IVF, pain control
-   Bowel rest vs. clear liquids (advance diet as tolerated)
-   IV antibiotics: should cover GNRs and anaerobic organisms
    -   -   Zosyn, cefepime + metronidazole, or meropenem (if high risk
            for organisms w/ESBL)
-   Continue IV abx until abdominal pain/tenderness is resolved (usually
    3-5 days), then transition to oral: cipro + metronidazole or
    Augmentin to complete 10-14 d course
-   Criteria for discharge:
    -   -   Resolution of vital sign abnormalities (fever, tachycardia,
            hypotension)
        -   Resolution of severe abdominal pain
        -   Improvement of leukocytosis
        -   Able to tolerate oral diet
-   Colonoscopy after complete resolution of symptoms (6 – 8 weeks) to
    definitively rule out presence of underlying colorectal cancer
    (unless performed in last year)

Additional Information

Complications:

-   Pts who fail to improve or deteriorate require repeat imaging
-   Abscess
    
    cont. Abx & Percutaneous drainage (if possible) for abscesses
    <u>\></u> 4 cm
    -   -   Surgery if no improvement 2-3 days after drainage
-   Obstruction: radiographic differentiation between acute
    diverticulitis and colon cancer is difficult; thus surgical
    resection of bowel is needed to relieve obstruction and r/o cancer
-   Fistula: Rarely heal spontaneously, require surgical correction
-   Bladder (65%), vagina (25%), small bowel (7%), uterus (3%)
-   Perforation:
    -   -   Microperforation (contained perforation):
            -   Presence
                of small amount of air bubbles, but no oral contrast
                outside of colon on CT
            -   Most
                treated with IV abx and bowel rest similar to
                uncomplicated diverticulitis
                -   

    -   Frank perforation:
        -   I
            ntraabdominal free
            air, diffuse peritonitis
            
            requires **emergency surgery**
