# Constipation
 
Constipation – Jacob Parnell

Background

-   Always consider if pt is at risk for obstruction (see SBO section)
-   Lactulose can cause severe cramping and bloating frequently
-   Can exchange PEG for lactulose in cirrhosis (but usually more
    bloating)
    -   Titrate lactulose BID to QID until 3-4 BMs achieved in cirrhosis
-   Combination therapy usually most effective
-   In pts with renal dysfunction/CKD, avoid Fleet enemas (sodium
    phosphate load)

Evaluation

-   Typical causes: medications (opioids, antidepressants, iron,
    anticholinergics)
    -   Poor diet (low-fiber), low fluid intake, reduced mobility, acute
        illness, electrolyte disturbances, IBS, GI disease (IBD, colon
        cancer)
-   Clinically diagnosis, no need for KUB/CT scans unless obstruction
    suspected
-   Consider BMP to evaluate electrolytes
-   Rectal exam can be used to exclude obstructing rectal mass or fecal
    impaction

Management

-   Stop any above offending meds as possible
-   Increase water intake
-   Escalating pathway for constipation:
    -   Senna BID + PEG (can give several times a day)
        
        try bisacodyl suppository
        
        then finally can try enema—tap water enema or SMOG enema
        (saline, mineral oil, glycerine)

Additional Information

-   “The hand that writes for opioids is also the hand that writes for a
    bowel regimen”
    -   Senna
        BID **+ PEG** daily (up to TID)
    -   If severe constipation already developed, do above plus try
        **methylnaltrexone**
-   CF pts (at risk for distal intestinal obstructive syndrome or DIOS)
    -   Not treated as true obstruction but rather like constipation
    -   PEG (QID) or just order “golytely” prep as if for colonoscopy
        preparation
