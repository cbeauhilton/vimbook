Intestinal Ischemia

– Michael Koenig

Acute Mesenteric Ischemia

-   Sudden
    onset
    ↓
    or absence of blood flow to the small intestines
-   Mesenteric Arterial Occlusion:
    -   -   Arterial
            Embolism:
            Associated with cardiac arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation),
            valvular
            disease
            , endocarditis, ventricular aneurysm, aortic
            atherosclerosis, and aortic aneurysm
        -   Arterial thrombosis: Most commonly from atherosclerotic
            disease; can also be 2/2 abdominal trauma, infection or
            dissection
-   Venous
    thrombosis:
    -   -   Associated
            w/ hypercoagulable states, malignancy, prior abdominal
            surgery, abdominal mass
            
            venous compression, intra-abdominal inflammatory processes
-   Non occlusive mesenteric ischemia:
    -   -   Intestinal
            hypoperfusion and vasoconstriction; associated w/ decreased
            cardiac output, sepsis, vasopressor use

Presentation

-   Early
    : Abdominal pain is most common symptom, abdominal distension
    -   -   Abdominal
            tenderness
            is not prominent early (“pain out of proportion to the
            exam”)
-   Arterial
    occlusion: Sudden onset, severe periumbilical pain, nausea and
    emesis
-   Venous
    thrombosis: More insidious onset abdominal pain, waxing and waning
-   Nonocclusive
    mesenteric ischemia: variable location and severity of abdominal
    pain;  often overshadowed by a precipitating disorder
-   Late: As transmural bowel infarction develops, abdomen becomes
    distended, bowel sounds become absent, and peritoneal signs develop

Evaluation

-   Type and Screen, Lactic acid, BMP, CBC
-   Imaging:
    KUB: Normal in > 25% of cases
    -   -   Ileus
            w/ distended bowel loops, bowel wall thickening,
            ±
            pneumatosis intestinalis
        -   Free
            intraperitoneal air
            
            immediate abdominal exploration
-   CT Angiography: no oral contrast, obscures mesenteric vessels,
    ↓
    bowel wall enhancement
    -   -   Focal
            or segmental bowel wall thickening, intestinal pneumatosis,
            portal vein gas, porto-mesenteric thrombosis, mesenteric
            arterial calcification, mesenteric artery occlusion

Management

-   General: IVFs, NPO, hemodynamic monitoring and support (try to avoid
    vasoconstricting agents), anticoagulation, broad-spectrum
    antibiotics, pain control
-   If develops peritonitis or evidence of perforation on CT
    
    EGS consult for surgery
-   Mesenteric arterial embolism: Embolectomy vs. local infusion of
    thrombolytic agent
-   Mesenteric arterial thrombosis: Surgical revascularization vs.
    thrombolysis with endovascular angioplasty and stenting
-   Venous thrombosis: Anticoagulation; possible thrombolysis if
    persistent symptoms
-   Nonocclusive occlusion: Treat underlying cause, stop
    vasoconstriction meds, consider intra-arterial vasodilator infusion.
    D/c anticoagulation once ischemic etiologies are excluded

Chronic Mesenteric Ischemia

-   ↓
    blood flow to intestines, typically caused by atherosclerosis of
    mesenteric vessel
-   Also known as intestinal angina
-   High-grade mesenteric vascular stenoses in at least two major
    vessels (celiac, SMA, or IMA) must be established
-   Ddx: Malignancy, chronic cholecystitis, chronic pancreatitis, IBD,
    PUD

Presentation

-   Recurrent dull, crampy, postprandial abdominal pain
-   Pts develop food aversion and often have associated weight loss

Evaluation

-   CT angiogram abdomen/pelvis is preferred (>90% sensitivity and
    specificity)
-   Can also consider duplex U/S and gastric tonometry

Management

-   Conservative management if asymptomatic: smoking cessation and
    secondary prevention to limit progression of atherosclerotic disease
-   Nutritional evaluation
-   Revascularization (open vs. endovascular) is indicated if symptoms
    are present
    -   Mesenteric angioplasty and stenting is first-line therapy
    -   Goal is to prevent future bowel infarction

Ischemic Colitis

-   Sudden, transient reduction in blood flow to colon
-   Typically at “watershed” regions of colon, such as the splenic
    flexure and rectosigmoid junction
-   Most often nonocclusive (95% of cases) and affects older adults
-   Risk factors: ACS, hemodialysis, shock, aortoiliac instrumentation,
    cardio pulmonary bypass, extreme exercise (marathon running)
-   Ddx: Small bowel ischemia, infectious colitis, IBD

Presentation

-   Rapid onset, mild cramping abdominal pain, associated with urge to
    defecate, hematochezia
-   Tenderness present (typically over left side)

Evaluation

-   Lactic acid (nonspecific but elevated), LDH, CPK, CBC
    (leukocytosis), BMP (metabolic acidosis)
-   KUB; if peritonitis or signs of severe ischemia
    →
    surgery
-   CT abdomen/pelvis w/ IV contrast (and oral contrast if patient can
    tolerate)
    -   Edema and bowel wall thickening in segmental pattern (suggests
        transient ischemia and subsequent reperfusion)
-   Consider CTA abdomen/pelvis if suspicion for vascular occlusion
-   Colonoscopy confirms diagnosis.
    -   Edematous, friable mucosa; erythema; and interspersed pale
        areas; bluish hemorrhagic nodules representing submucosal
        bleeding
    -   Segmental distribution, abrupt transition between injured and
        non-injured mucosa, rectal sparing, and single linear ulcer
        along longitudinal axis of colon

Management

-   General: IVFs, bowel rest
-   Broad Spectrum Antibiotics: zosyn alone or CTX + flagyl
-   Risk Stratify: associated factors which predict poor outcomes
    -   Male gender
    -   SBP \<90
    -   HR >100
    -   WBC >15,000
    -   Hgb \<12
    -   Na \<136
    -   BUN >20
    -   LDH >350
    -   Isolated right-sided colonic involvement

<!-- -->

-   Abdominal pain with rectal bleeding
-   Mild colonic ischemia (no above risk factors):
    sigmoidoscopy/colonoscopy and biopsy
    -   Observation/supportive care; can discontinue antibiotics if no
        ulceration
-   Moderate colonic ischemia (1-3 risk factors)
    →
    if there is evidence of mesenteric arterial or venous occlusion then
    start systemic anticoagulation +/- vascular intervention
    -   If no vascular occlusion, then management is the same as mild
        colonic ischemia
-   Severe colonic ischemia (peritoneal signs, pneumoperitoneum,
    pneumatosis, portal venous gas on imaging; gangrene or pancolonic
    ischemia on colonoscopy; >3 risk factors)
    :
    consult EGS
    for
    abdominal exploration and segmental resection
