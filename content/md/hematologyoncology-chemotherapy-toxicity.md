# Chemotherapy Toxicity
 
Chemotherapy Toxicities - Beau Hilton

-   The role of Intern/Resident on the Hematology/Oncology services is
    largely to work with the fellow to monitor and manage adverse
    effects of chemotherapy
-   Concerns about specific immune-related adverse event: refer to
    “Toxicities associated with checkpoint inhibitor immunotherapy,” on
    UpToDate
-   Treatment of immune checkpoint inhibitor toxicities: “Management of
    Immunotherapy-Related Toxicities” in the NCCN Guidelines for
    Supportive Care section

Neutropenia:

-   Chemotherapy-associated: usually 5-18 days after treatment
-   Cancer infiltrate of bone marrow
-   New occult infection: especially EBV, CMV
-   Patients can be safely discharged with ANC > 500

Mucositis:

-   Worst in pts receiving concurrent radiation to head and neck,
    rectum, prostate
-   Begins shortly after chemo dose, usually peaks on day 7
-   High risk: bleomycin, cytarabine, anthracyclines, etoposide, 5-FU,
    methotrexate
-   Treatment: “Salt and soda” rinses (1 tsp salt, 1 tsp baking sode in
    1-quart water, swish and spit 5 times per day), viscous lidocaine,
    capsaicin candy, Magic Mouthwash

Immune Checkpoint Inhibitor Toxicities:

Treatment: low-dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 0.5 mg/kg) for mild
adverse events, high dose glucocorticoids (prednisone, 1-2 mg/kg) for
severe adverse events
