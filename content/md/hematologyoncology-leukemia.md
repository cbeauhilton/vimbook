Acute Leukemia - Robert Corty

Background

-   Unchecked proliferation of WBC precursors causes marrow failure
-   Can be fatal in days to months
-   Pt’s with suspected acute leukemia require hospitalization for
    urgent diagnosis & treatment
-   APL has both the highest in-hospital mortality & highest cure rate
-   Types:
    -   AML
        = Acute Myeloid Leukemia – most common
    -   APL
        = acute promyelocytic leukemia
        
        translocation (15;17)
    -   ALL
        = acute lymphocytic leukemia
-   Risk Factors:
    -   ionizing radiation
    -   chemical exposures(e.g benzene)
    -   HIV
    -   immunosuppression
    -   myeloproliferative disorders
    -   aplastic anemia
    -   chemotherapy, specifically, alkylating agents and topoisomerase
        inhibitors

Presentation

-   Leukocytosis, often blastocytosis: leukemia cutis, gingival
    hypertrophy, leukostasis
-   Functional Leukopenia, often neutropenia: recurrent infections
-   Anemia: fatigue, pallor, dyspnea
-   Thrombocytopenia: gingival bleeding, epistaxis, petechiae,
    ecchymoses, menorrhagia
-   Extramedullary hematopoiesis: splenomegaly, hepatomegaly,
    lymphadenopathy

Evaluation

-   Diagnosis of acute leukemia requires one of the following:
    -   20% blasts in peripheral blood
    -   \> 20% blasts in bone marrow biopsy
    -   Any pathognomonic cytogenetic abnormality of t(8;21), inv(16),
        t(15;17)
-   Check for the presence of these time-sensitive conditions.
    -   DIC – check fibrinogen, PT, PTT, platelets
    -   TLS – check uric acid, phosphate, LDH, K+
    -   Neutropenic fever – check temp, neutrophil count
    -   Leukostasis  (see below)
    -   Presumptive APL – promyelocytes on diff, DIC or Auer rods on
        smear
-   Confirm if peripheral flow cytometry ordered/in process

<!-- -->

-   Use hematology admission order set
    -   Set RBC and Plt transfusion thresholds
    -   Order nurse-driven electrolyte repletion
    -   ECG and TTE to establish pre-chemotherapy cardiac function
    -   Daily labs: CBC, TLS, DIC
    -   TLS prophylaxis

Management

-   Page heme fellow
    -   Discuss chemo plan and order double lumen PICC for reliable
        access
    -   If findings suggest APL discuss starting ATRA
    -   Subspecialized lab tests: bone marrow biopsy, cytogenetics, FISH
-   Monitor for Common Complications/Emergencies: (see individual
    sections)
    -   TLS, DIC, Febrile Neutropenia, Leukostasis

Additional Information

-   Obtain blood product consent on admission
-   APL Specific findings: promyelocytes on differential or Auer rods on
    smear
-   Differentiation syndrome: promyelocytes differentiate
    -   Symptoms and signs: fever, SOB, Hypotn, peripheral edema,
        pleural effusion, AKI
    -   Diagnosis: No defined criteria.  If suspicious, discuss with
        hematology fellow
    -   Management: **steroids** .  If critically ill, **hold** **ATRA**
        **and** **ATO** and consider **hydroxyurea**

Leukemia Treatment Overview

-   General strategy is to use “induction” chemo to try to induce
    clinicopathologic (as opposed to molecular) “remission”
-   Defined as absence of symptoms, normal CBC, and \< 5% blasts in bone
    marrow (on day 28)
-   Then waiting in hospital until neutrophil count > 500 (typically \~3
    weeks)
-   From there, bone marrow transplant (for high risk disease) or
    “consolidation” chemo for normal-risk or low-risk disease

AML

Induction

-   Typical is “7+3” i.e. idrarubicin on days 1-3 and cytarabine on days
    1-7
-   If therapy-related AML, MDS-related AML, or AML with cytogenetics
    similar to MDS, use “Vyxeos” which is liposomal daunorubicin and
    cytarabine on days 1, 3, and 5
-   If low-risk dz (t(8;21) or inv(16)), use cytarabine on days 1-7, and
    3 days of low-dose daunorubicin + gemtuzumab-ozogamicin
-   There are other induction regimens that can be used depending on
    specific cytogenetics and patient frailty, which is beyond beyond
    the scope of the handbook

Consolidation

-   Typically  “HiDAC”(high-dose Ara-C – brand name for cytarabine)
    -   Generally too toxic for pts with age > 60, so a dose reduction
        is used
-   In the case of relapse, typical treatment is a different high-dose
    chemo and BMT if possible

ALL

-   Typical induction is “HyperCVAD” (hyper-fractionated
    cyclophosphamide, vincristine, doxorubicin (“A” due to trade name
    Adriamycin), and dexamethasone
-   If t(9;22) (known as Philadelphia chromosome), use tyrosine kinase
    inhibitor (TKI)
-   If CD20+, use rituximab (requires CNS prophylaxis)
