Oncologic Emergencies – Madeleine Turcotte

Leukostasis

Presentation

-   Respiratory: dyspnea, hypoxia (note CXR may be normal)
    -   PaO2 by ABG often falsely low dt WBC consuming O2 *in vitro* .
        Trust SpO2.
-   CNS: headache, AMS, vision changes, dizziness, tinnitus, gait
    instability, neuro deficit

Evaluation

-   CBC with diff and peripheral blood smear
-   Imaging: CT head to evaluate neuro deficit and to check for ICH
-   Chest X-Ray vs CT chest to evaluate dyspnea

Management

-   Page hematology fellow for guidance if you feel this dx is likely
-   Hydrea (discuss with fellow) Hydrea 50 – 100 mg/kg/day divided
    between bid dosing
-   Emergent cytoreduction
    -   Leukapheresis: page nephrology and place dialysis catheter
-   Chemotherapy per hematology fellow
-   Transfer/admit to ICU

Tumor Lysis Syndrome - Bradley Christensen

Background

-   Lysis of malignant cells either spontaneously or in response to
    chemotherapy causing release of K, Phos, nucleic acids, and
    cytokines
-   Consequences:
    -   Hyperkalemia- most urgent and immediately life threatening
    -   Hyperphosphatemia- binds Ca2+ and leads to CaP crystal
        deposition-> AKI, HypoCa
    -   Hyperuricemia (from breakdown of DNA)->precipitation in renal
        tubules->AKI
    -   Hypotension, AKI from cytokine release
-   Laboratory TLS (at least
    two within 2d before or 7d after start of chemotherapy):
    -   Uric acid ≥ 8 mg/dL, Ca2+ ≤ 7 mg, K+ ≥ 6 mEq/L, or PO43- ≥ 4.5
        mg/dL /dL
    -   OR > 25% change from baseline in these values
-   Clinical TLS: laboratory TLS + AKI, arrhythmia, seizure, tetany,
    death

Evaluation

-   Risk Stratification:
    -   Highest risk
        **after** tarting chemotherapy, but can occur spontaneously
-   Tumor characteristics which confer a **higher risk** of developing
    TLS:
    -   High (>5% risk): ALL (WBC> 100K or LDH 2x ULN), AML (WBC> 100K),
        Burkitt’s (III/IV or LDH≥2xULN, DLBCL with bulky disease,
        intermediate risk + AKI/CKD
    -   Intermediate: ALL (WBC\<100K, LDH \<2x ULN), AML (WBC 25-100K),
        Burkitt’s LDH\<2x ULN), DLBCL (non-bulky, LDH>ULN), CLL (if tx
        with fludarabine, rituximab, lenalidomide, or venetoclax +LN
        5-10 cm or ALC≥25K), plasma cell leukemia, rare chemo-sensitive
        solid tumors (small cell)
    -   Low: all others

Management

Prevention:

-   High risk:  q8h TLS labs, IVF (±loop diuretic if volume overload),
    allopurinol, ± rasburicase
-   Intermediate – q8h TLS labs, IVF, allopurinol
-   Low – daily TLS labs, IVF
    -   Significant hydration: goal to maintain UOP 80-100 mL/hr
    -   Allopurinol: 300 mg PO BID for CrCl > 20 mL/min, UpToDate renal
        dosing if lower
    -   Rasburicase ($$$): contraindicated in G6PD (send G6PD if not
        urgent and AA, Asian or Jewish descent)
        -   Given if
            uric acid > 8 mg/dL: get fellow approval before ordering

Treatment: (Can use as night/cross cover handoff)

-   K <sup>+</sup> <u>\></u> 5.5:  STAT EKG. Kayexalate 30g orally or
    60g per rectum (unless contraindicated) x1
    -   Give 10 U insulin/1 amp D50
    -   If EKG changes, then calcium gluconate and D5W at 100 mL/hr with
        repeat BG in 1 hr
-   Uric acid <u>\></u> 8 with 25% change from baseline: page hematology
    fellow to discuss rasburicase
-   PO4 <u>\></u> 4.5 with 25% change from baseline: start/
    ↑
    phos binder (sevelamer)
    -   Dialysis may be necessary in patients with poor renal function.
-   IV calcium: do not administer unless symptomatic AND
    hyperphosphatemia is corrected
    -   With high phos, IV calcium can lead to calcium deposition and
        renal failure
-   Hemodialysis: pt with anuria, refractory hyperkalemia, and
    symptomatic hypocalcemia
-   Consequence of WBC’s plugging up microvasculature
-   Most common in AML with hyperleukocytosis (defined as WBC > 100K/
    µL
    )
-   If cell not sticky (CLL) generally not going to cause despite high
    WBC count.

Superior Vena Cava (SVC) Syndrome ****

Background

-   Commonly
    Associated Malignancies: Lung Cancer, Non-Hodgkin or Hodgkin
    Lymphoma, Mediastinal Germ Cell Tumors, Thymic Malignancies
-   Partial or complete obstruction of the SVC impedes blood return from
    the upper extremities, head, neck, and brain resulting in upstream
    congestion
-   Can be 2/2 a
    mass in the mediastinum or thrombosis (foreign body i.e. catheter)

Presentation

-   Facial or neck swelling without generalized edema
-   Sense of head fullness, exacerbated by leaning forward or lying
    down, which may indicate cerebral edema
-   Pulmonary symptoms including dyspnea, stridor, hoarseness, cough -
    due to edema narrowing the nasal passages and larynx or mechanical
    airway obstruction
-   Physical Exam: facial and neck edema particularly of the eye lids in
    the morning, distended neck and chest veins; can also sometimes see
    upper extremity swelling, papilledema, plethora. Look for associated
    lymph node enlargement anywhere particularly including
    supraclavicular, cervical and axillary region

Evaluation

-   AFP,
    β
    -hCG if no tissue Dx
-   CXR: may show mass, perihilar or mediastinal disease
-   Contrasted CT scan ± CT Venography:  Phased to get a view of clot
    contribution to obstruction
    
    guides decision regarding anticoagulation or stenting
    -   Radiology
        attending can coordinate with techs (requires verbal direct
        request)
-   MRI/MRV may provide additional information (often not possible due
    to pt too sick)

Management

-   Assess airway and prepare for intubation if needed
-   Keep head of bed elevated
-   Thrombosis:
    -   Removal of lines/catheters associated with thrombus
    -   Consideration of anticoagulation (risks vs benefits patient
        dependent)
-   Tumor compression: the type of tumor guides treatment (tissue biopsy
    is key)
-   Stat/urgent consultations:
    -   Interventional radiology for possible stenting/dilatation
    -   Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy
    -   Interventional pulmonology – for help with tissue dx
    -   Medical oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy

Spinal Cord Compression

Background

-   Malignancies
    where cord compression is most common:
-   Multiple Myeloma, Lymphoma (both Hodgkin and NHL), Lung, Breast,
    Prostate Cancer
-   Tumor mass & compressed and often displaced bone
    
    impinges thecal sac or nerve roots spinal cord or any spinal nerves
    including the cauda equina
-   Impingement causes pain and can lead to neurologic dysfunction

Presentation

-   Back pain, motor or sensory deficits
-   Cauda Equina syndrome
    
    bowel or bladder incontinence, ataxia

Evaluation

-   Neurologic exam with sensation testing seeking level below an
    identified dermatome
-   Lab testing: If no known malignancy check CBC, CMP, SPEP, and (in
    males) PSA
-   Bladder US if suspicion or retention with or without overflow
    incontinence

Management

-   If suspected, MRI without and with contrast best for diagnosis; if
    patient unable to have MRI, CT myelography may be considered
-   Immediate high dose steroids (dosing is controversial with
    recommendations ranging from 4 to 100 mg of **dexamethasone** q6h -
    choice of dexamethasone is to minimize mineralocorticoid effects.
    Most common dosing is 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h)
-   Consider
    stat/urgent consultation with:
    -   Neurosurgery for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention
    -   Radiation oncology- for radiation therapy
    -   Medical
        oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy
-   Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring.
-   E
    arly PT if LE weakness

Brain Metastases

Background

-   Common Malignancies: Lung (NSCLC), breast, kidney, colorectal
    carcinomas & melanomas
-   Significantly more common than primary brain tumors
-   Occur in 10 - 30% of adults w/systemic malignancies
-   80% of brain mets occur in the cerebrum at grey/white matter
    junction

Presentation

-   Highly variable: so consider brain mets any cancer pt w/ neurologic
    or behavioral changes
-   Headache: worse in the mornings, with bending over or with valsalva
-   Nausea/vomiting
-   Cognitive dysfunction: changes in memory, mood or personality
-   Focal neurologic deficits
-   Signs of elevated ICP: papilledema, vision changes, drowsiness,
    presyncope
    -   Seizures
    -   Stroke (particularly in melanoma, choriocarcinoma, thyroid &
        renal carcinomas)

Evaluation

-   STAT CT if concerned for stroke or elevated ICP
-   MRI with contras: most sensitive, can differentiate b/w metastases
    vs. other lesions
    -   Suggestive
        features: multiple lesions, location, circumscribed margins,
        vasogenic edema
-   If pt has no known primary tumor: consider CT C/A/P +/- PET to
    identify primary
-   Biopsy with histopathology & IHC: if diagnosis in doubt or if only a
    single lesion is present

Management

-   If severe HA, N/V, focal deficits: systemic glucocorticoids
    -   Dexamethasone 10mg IV x1 followed by 4mg IV q6h (can be PO if
        tolerated)
-   Stat/urgent consults:
    -   Neurosurgery
        – for diagnostic/therapeutic intervention
    -   Radiation
        oncology – for radiation therapy
    -   Medical
        oncology – for help with diagnosis and chemotherapy
-   Ensure regular neuro-vascular checks and close monitoring
-   Do not perform LP without input from neurology
