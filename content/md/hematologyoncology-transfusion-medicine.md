Transfusion Medicine – R. Dixon Dorand

VUMC: search “Blood” and select General Blood Administration – follow
prompts

For emergent transfusions, call the blood bank (615-322-2233)

-   RNs on 10T and 11N can follow transfusion protocols for pRBCs and
    Plts – enter as a Nursing Communication or as part of the
    Hematology/Oncology Admission Order set.
-   Nurses will NOT check post-transfusion levels unless you specify to
    do so; this is only needed in specific scenarios (e.g. “platelet
    refractoriness”)
-   At VUMC, all special processing of blood products (such as
    irradiation) will be decided by blood bank based on special
    considerations listed in order set. Examples include: stem cell
    transplant, hematologic malignancy, or thalassemia
-   Patients with
    frequent transfusions (e.g. sickle cell hemoglobinopathy) should
    have an RBC Extended Phenotype ordered (once) for minor RBC antigens
    to avoid immunization and antibody development to these proteins
-   You may ask the VUMC hematology lab to email you pictures of the
    peripheral smear

VA: Orders Tab – Blood Bank Orders – follow prompts to select
appropriate product. Must order both the blood product AND the
transfusion order (“Transfuse blood”)

-   You need to specify all special processing such as irradiation
-   To order a Type & Screen as a lab, you must go to Blood Bank Orders
-   Type & Screen and Transfusion results are under the Blood tab in
    Results

Remember:

-   You must send Type and Screen & consent the patient
-   To consent at VUMC, use Medex. To consent at the VA, use iMedConsent
-   On Brittingham or BMT, all blood products must be irradiated. This
    will happen at VUMC if you
    select the right indication for blood; at the VA you must still
    specify this.

Red Blood Cell Transfusion

-   Volume
    200-300 mL per unit prbc
-   In general, 1 unit of packed RBCs increases Hgb by 1g/dL and hct by
    \~3%
-   Assessment
    of the post-transfusion Hgb can be performed 15 min following
    transfusion, but ideally 1 hour after completion  

Indications:

-   Hgb \<9-10 g/dL – Acute coronary syndrome
-   Hgb \<8 g/dL or Hct \<25 – Bone marrow failure or receiving
    antineoplastic therapy
    -   Also
        sometimes
        used in pts with pre-existing CAD
-   Hgb \<7 g/
    dL or Hct \<21 – ICU, GI Bleeding, Oncology patient on Treatment

Indications for Platelets

-   \<11 k/µL – all patients, reduce risk of spontaneous hemorrhage (use
    on BMT, Brittingham)
-   \<20 k/µL – patients receiving induction chemotherapy with a fever
-   \<50 k/µL – active bleeding, scheduled to undergo select invasive
    procedure
-   \<100 k/µL – CNS hemorrhage, intrathecal catheter
    -   This is also the threshold used for most Neurosurgical
        procedures

Fresh Frozen Plasma (FFP) & Cryoprecipitate (Cryo)

Cryoprecipitate: FFP enriched for von Willebrand factor, factor VIII,
factor XIII, and fibrinogen

FFP:

-   Once thawed, must be used in 24 hrs (due to decline in labile
    coagulation factors)
-   Must be ABO compatible but not crossmatched or Rh typing
-   Only administer FFP if INR ≥1.7 (FFP will not fix an INR \< 1.7)

Indications for transfusion:

\- Bleeding:

-   FFP If INR >1.7
-   Cryoprecipitate if fibrinogen \<100.

\- DIC:

-   Fibrinogen \<100: Transfuse 5 – 10 units cryoprecipitate and repeat
    fibrinogen. If bleeding, consider raising transfusion threshold of
    cryoprecipitate to fibrinogen \<150
-   For
    elevated INR, consider FFP transfusion. Thresholds for doing this
    vary by attending  

\- Cirrhosis **:**

-   General concept: PT/INR, aPTT are unreliable markers for bleeding.
    Fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 or thromboelastography are better surrogates
    for bleeding risk
-   Transfuse fibrinogen ≤100 – 120 if the patient is actively bleeding
    or about to undergo a procedure or surgery other than paracentesis
-   Transfuse FFP based on hepatology team preference (generally few
    indications for FFP)

Transfusion Premedication & Reactions

-   If you are concerned about a serious transfusion reaction, pause the
    transfusion and contact the blood bank asap
-   Order the transfusion reaction blood testing in Epic. You will send
    a CBC, the bag of blood products, and the completed form to the
    blood bank for analysis

Premedication:

-   Only
    if history of severe reaction
    -   Diphenhydramine 25-50mg IV
    -   Acetaminophen 650 mg PO
    -   Meperidine
        25-50 mg IV (optional for chills)
    -   Hydrocortisone 50 mg IV (optional, for severe reactions or
        reactions despite acetaminophen and diphenhydramine)
