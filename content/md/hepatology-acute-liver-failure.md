# Acute Liver Failure
 
Acute Liver Failure  (ALF)– Judd Heideman , Hannah Lomzenski

Background

-   Elevated aminotransferases
-   INR
    ≥
    1.5
-   Hepatic encephalopathy/altered mental status
-   Timing/onset
    \< 28 weeks (otherwi
    se consider acute-on-chronic liver failure/cirrhosis)
-   Acute liver injury (ALI) = elevated aminotransferases + INR >1.5 but
    NO hepatic encephalopathy (see above)
-   Pts with acute presentation of chronic autoimmune hepatitis,
    hepatitis B infection, Wilson disease, and Budd-Chiari syndrome are
    considered to have ALF if they develop HE, despite the presence of a
    pre-existing liver disease in the context of appropriate
    abnormalities in liver blood tests and coagulation profile
-   For DILI, consider recently added medications
-   Drugs Associated with DILI (search LiverTox database for the pts
    meds and likelihood of DILI)
    -   Hepatocellular pattern
        : acarbose,
        Acetaminophen, Allopurinol, Amiodarone, Baclofen, Bupropion,
        Fluoxetine, HAART (Nevirapine), Kava kava, Isoniazid,
        Ketoconazole, Lisinopril, Losartan, Methotrexate, NSAIDs,

        Propylthiouracil, Rifampin, Risperidone, Sertraline, Statins,
        Tetracycline, Trazodone, Valproic Acid
    -   Mixed pattern
        : Amitriptyline,
        Azathioprine, Captopril, Carbamazepine, Clindamycin,
        Cyproheptadine, Enalapril, Flutemide, Nitrofurantoin,
        Phenobarbital, Phenytoin, Sulfonamides, Trazodone, Verapamil
    -   Cholestatic
        **pattern** : Amoxicillin-clavulanic acid,
        Anabolic steroids, Chlorpromazine, Clopidogrel, Oral

Evaluation

-   Consult hepatology early! (assist with workup AND for transplant
    evaluation)
-   Labs:
    -   CBC w/diff, CMP, Mg, Phos, T&S, BCx, UCx
    -   PT/INR, aPTT, Fibrinogen (to assess for DIC/coagulopathy)
    -   Amylase, lipase (to look for complications of ALF like
        pancreatitis)
    -   Acetaminophen level (needs to be drawn at least 4hrs after last
        known ingestion)
    -   Salicylate level, UDS
    -   Viral Hepatitis Serologies
    -   HAV IgM  (“Hepatitis A Pnl”), HBV sAg, sAb, cIgM (all in
        “Hepatitis B Panel”), HCV IgG (“Hepatitis C IgG”; consider PCR
        Qt if HCV IgG positive), Hepatitis D if known HBV (Misc
        Reference Test), Hepatitis E if travel to southeast Asia or
        pregnant (“Hepatitis E IgM- ARUP”)
    -   EBV Qt, CMV Qt, HSV 1/2 Qt, VZV IgM/IgG
    -   Beta-hCG for females of childbearing age
    -   ANA, ASMA
    -   Anti-LKM-1 Ab associated with more indolent autoimmune
        hepatitis/chronic liver disease (type 2 autoimmune hepatitis)
        and generally does not cause ALF
    -   ABG with arterial lactate, ammonia
    -   Arterial ammonia >124 predicts mortality and CNS complications
        (e.g., need for intubation, seizures, cerebral edema)
    -   HIV p24 Ag and HIV 1/2 Ab
-   Imaging:
    -   RUQ abdominal ultrasound **with doppler** (important to assess
        vasculature!)
    -   Consider CT with contrast in patients with normal renal function
        and high suspicion of Budd-Chiari syndrome or malignancy with
        negative ultrasound  (better for assessing the hepatic veins)
        and helps with transplant evaluation
    -   Consider TTE to rule out cardiac dysfunction; helpful for
        transplant consideration

Criteria for Transplantation:

-   King’s College criteria:
    helps identify patients needing transplant referral/consideration
    -   ALF due to acetaminophen:
        -   Arterial pH \<7.3 after resuscitation and >24 hr since
            ingestion, OR
        -   Lactate >3, OR
        -   HE > grade 3, SCr >3.4, **and** INR >6.5
-   ALF not due to acetaminophen: INR > 6.5 OR 3 of the 5 following
    criteria:
    -   Indeterminate etiology, drug-induced hepatitis
    -   Age \<10 or >40
    -   Interval of jaundice to encephalopathy >7 days
    -   Bilirubin > 3 or INR >3.5
-   No role for MELD-Na in acute liver failure

Management

-   Any pt with concern for ALF should be cared for in MICU
-   Pts with ALF die acutely from hypoglycemia, cerebral edema, and
    infection
-   ABC’s:
    -   Intubate for GCS \<8, Grade 3 or 4 HE
    -   IVF resuscitation with isotonic crystalloid (most pts are volume
        deplete; avoid hypotonic fluids due to risk of cerebral edema)
    -   Vasopressive agents for persistent hypotension (norepinephrine
        preferred)
-   Monitoring:
    -   Q1-2h neuro checks, Q1-2h glucose checks
    -   Q8h INR (no mortality benefit from empiric FFP/coag products)
    -   BID BMP, daily Mg, P
    -   Daily Hepatic Function Panel (generally no need for more
        frequent trending)
-   Treatment of Primary Injury
    -   IV N-acetylcysteine - improves transplant-free survival even in
        patients WITHOUT acetaminophen induced acute liver failure
        -   Initial loading dose = 150mg/kg over 1 hour, then 50mg/kg/hr
            for 4 hours, then 100mg/kg/hr for 16 hours ​​​​​​​
        -   Patients with early stage hepatic encephalopathy (grade
            I/II) have increased transplant free survival, while those
            with grade III/IV do not
    -   See below for etiology-specific treatment; hepatology consult
        for LT eval
    -   Early toxicology consultation if suspected ingestion/overdose
        -   For acute management contact Poison Control **800-222-1222**
-   Treatment of Secondary Complications
    -   Infection: abx only if progressing HE, signs of infection, or
        development of SIRS; ppx abx do not reduce mortality
    -   Cerebral edema/increased ICP:  elevated HOB to 30 degrees, quiet
        and dimly lit room, minimize IVF, goal Na 145-155,
        hyperventilation if concern for impending herniation. Consider
        3% saline (500mL) and/or mannitol (1g/kg, 20%) for pt at highest
        risk (serum ammonia >150, grade III/IV HE, ARF, vasopressor
        support
    -   Seizures: phenytoin (no evidence to support seizure ppx)
    -   Renal Failure: early CRRT if persistent Metabolic Acidosis,
        Volume Overload, Hyperammonemia, falling UOP
    -   Coagulopathy: IV Vit K; products for invasive procedures or
        active bleeding only
-   Additional Supportive Care
    -   PPI for bleeding ppx
    -   Enteral nutrition within 2-3 days; avoid TPN if possible; avoid
        NG feeds if progressive HE; NG should only be placed w/
        intubation as gagging increases ICP
    -   Avoid sedation as able; if sedation required, prefer propofol
        for better neuro exams to evaluate encephalopathy
    -   Lactulose possibly helpful in the early stages of encephalopathy

Specific Management by Etiology:

-   Acetaminophen – IV N-acetylcysteine per protocol, look up
    Rumack-Mattew Nomogram and consult with tox; ideally, start NAC \<8
    hours after ingestion for best results (hepatotoxicity develops 12
    hours post-ingestion)
    -   Search “N-acetylcysteine” and select order set “Acetaminophen
        overdose”
    -   Plan for serial acetaminophen level, INR, LFTs to be drawn 2
        hours before the end of each N-acetylcysteine bag
-   Amanita phalloides
    – PO charcoal, IV penicillin, IV acetylcysteine
-   AFLP/HELLP – delivery
-   Autoimmune – IV steroids following approval by hepatology.
    Azathioprine generally deferred until cholestasis resolved
-   HAV/HEV – supportive care
-   HBV – nucleoside analogue; orthotopic liver transplant
-   HCV – consider treatment if no viral clearance
-   Budd-Chiari – anticoagulation, consider stent before TIPS
-   HSV – acyclovir
-   Wilson’s – plasma exchange; orthotopic liver transplant

Additional Information

Prognosis:

-   Hyperacute (\<7 days) = better prognosis
    -   Cerebral edema common
-   Subacute (\<28 days) = poorer prognosis
    -   Renal failure, portal hypertension more common
-   By Etiology:
    -   Acetaminophen: 60% survival without transplant (100% if NAC
        started within 16 hrs)
    -   Other drug related injury: 30% survival without transplant
    -   Hepatitis A: 60% survival without transplant
    -   Acute Hepatitis B: 25% survival without transplant
