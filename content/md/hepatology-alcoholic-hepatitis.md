| Alcoholic Hepatitis – Alex Wiles, Julie Cui |

Background

-   Acute onset of rapidly progressive jaundice in pt with heavy EtOH
    intake (>40g in females or >60g in males EtOH/day for >6 mos, or
    within \<60 days of abstinence).
    -   -   

    -   May present after they have quit drinking due to
        immunosuppressive effects of alcohol.

    -   20-50% Mortality in hospitalized AH pts

Evaluation

-   AST >60, AST/ALT >1.5, both values \<400 IU/L; TBili >3.0 mg/dL,
    documentation of heavy EtOH use until 8 weeks prior to presentation
-   Prognostication with Maddrey’s Discriminant Function: 4.6 \* (PT
    <sub>pt</sub> – PT <sub>ctrl</sub> ) + Tbili
    -   Maddrey
        \>
        32 = poor 30d prognosis & may benefit from steroids (see below)
-   RUQ to rule out obstructive cause of jaundice
-   Biopsy is not typically required but will show neutrophilic lobular
    inflammation, hepatocyte ballooning, steatosis, and pericellular
    fibrosis.
-   Phosphatidylethanol (PEth) level is a biomarker of ethanol
    consumption over \~ 4wks; >20 ng/mL can indicate chronic
    moderate/heavy alcohol intake
    -   A single episode consumption can result in detectable Peth for
        up to 12 days. Can be elevated for months with regular heavy
        alcohol intake.
    -   In some studies, 99% sensitive and specific for alcoholism.
    -   EtOH levels may be negative unless acutely intoxicated  

Management

-   Supportive Care is essential! Consult Nutrition, start High protein,
    high calorie diet, high dose Thiamine x 3d, Folate, MVI
-   Full infection workup (CXR, UA, BCx, paracentesis) regardless of sxs
-   Steroids:
    STOP-AH Trial (NEJM 2015) showed improved mortality at 28 days but
    not at 90 days in patients with Maddrey <u>\></u> 32 who received
    steroids; the decision to treat is very nuanced and should be
    discussed with hepatology attending
    -   Contraindications to steroids include: presence of infection
        (must rule out first
        including TB, uncontrolled GI bleeding, AKI w/ Cr >2.5 mg/dL)
        ​​​​​​​
    -   Prednisolone 40mg daily for pts who meet above criteria (2018
        ACG Guidelines)
    -   The Lille score can be used to guide continuation or d/c  of
        steroids after 7 d of therapy
    -   NAC can be considered as adjunctive therapy to steroids and may
        decrease 30-day mortality, though has not demonstrated longer
        mortality benefit at 3 nor 6 months
    -   Recent analysis from STOP AH data has demonstrated that pts with
        neutrophil to lymphocyte ratio (NLR) 5-8 prior to steroids most
        likely to benefit from steroids
-   Monitor on CIWA
    -   Psychiatry consultation as appropriate, consideration of medical
        therapy
        -   Disulfiram and naltrexone are both metabolized by the liver
            and can cause hepatic toxicity and therefore are not used in
            this population
        -   Baclofen has been shown to improve alcohol abstinence in pts
            with EtOH cirrhosis
        -   Acamprosate has not been studied in this population but can
            be considered
        -   Gabapentin has also demonstrated efficacy and can be given
            up to 1200mg for AUD

Liver transplantation

-   Current VUMC policy: pts should be abstinent for no less than 3-6
    months, although exceptions may be made for early liver transplant
    based on a very strict protocol
    -   Sustained Alcohol use post- Liver Transplant (SALT) score
        ≤
        6
        -   +4 points if >10 drinks/day at initial hospitalization
        -   +4 points if multiple prior rehab attempts
        -   +2 points if prior alcohol related legal issues
        -   +1 points if prior illicit substance abuse
-   “Exceptions:”
    Severe AH as first liver-decompensating event in patients who are
    not expected to survive to complete treatment
    -   Presence of strong sober social support
    -   Absence of severe uncontrolled coexisting psychiatric disorders
    -   Agreement by patient and family to adhere therapy and lifelong
        abstinence
