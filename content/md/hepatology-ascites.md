Background

-   US \~80% due to cirrhosis and associated portal hypertension
-   Less common causes: peritoneal or metastatic cancer, heart failure,
    tuberculosis, nephrotic syndrome, Budd-Chiari, sinusoidal
    obstructive syndrome (S.O.S), or complications from procedures and
    pancreatitis

| Grade 1 Ascites | Only seen on imaging                     | 2g Na restriction                                   |
| Grade 2 Ascites | Moderate, symmetric abdominal distension | 2g Na restriction, diuretics                        |
| Grade 3 Ascites | Marked, tense abdominal distension       | LVP + Na restriction, diuretics (unless refractory) |

Evaluation

-   Bedside ultrasound on admission to confirm presence of ascites
-   Diagnostic paracentesis in all pts with ascites on admission mainly
    to rule out occult SBP
    -   Initial paracentesis or when cause of ascites is uncertain:
        Total Protein, serum and BF Albumin, cell count w/diff, culture
    -   Subsequent/Serial paracenteses: cell count w/diff, culture,
        protein
    -   Always inoculate culture bottles at bedside (aerobic, then
        anaerobic)! Use luer-lock syringe and vacutainer, then hand
        deliver samples to 4 <sup>th</sup> floor lab to ensure
        proper/timely delivery
-   There is no guideline for INR cutoff for paracentesis, although our
    procedure team often looks for INR \< 3.5 (IR usually doesn’t care
    about INR)
-   Serum-ascites albumin gradient (SAAG
    ) = serum albumin - ascites albumin. SAAG ≥ 1.1 accurately predicts
    portal hypertension, but this may be due to either cardiac or
    hepatic causes which can be further evaluated with total protein in
    the ascites:

-   Calculate PMNs from fluid: Total nucleated cells x percent
    neutrophils
    -   If ≥> 250, diagnostic of SBP in cirrhosis
-   Correction for RBCs: For every 250 RBCs in fluid, subtract 1 PMN
-   Other tests:
    -   -   Triglycerides: if fluid is milky
        -   Cytology: if very concerned for peritoneal carcinomatosis.
            May need up to 3 separate samples (50ml or more) to be able
            to detect malignant cells
        -   ADA: if concern for peritoneal TB
        -   Hematocrit: For bloody appearing fluid (not just
            serosanguinous) to rule out hemoperitoneum. There needs to
            be a recent serum HCT for comparison.
        -   Amylase: If concerned for pancreatic ascites
        -   Glucose, LDH if concern about secondary peritonitis (see
            below)

Management

-   Cessation of alcohol, if applicable
-   2000mg sodium restriction per day for all ascites (Grade 1-3)
-   Diuretics (spironolactone and typically oral furosemide)
    -   Start at 100mg of spironolactone with up titration to 400mg
    -   Furosemide is added if insufficient diuresis or if limited by
        hyperkalemia
    -   Can then
        ↑
        to a max of 400:160
    -   If poor response can change to torsemide 10 and
        ↑
        40 mg max for cirrhotics
    -   Fluid restriction usually not necessary unless serum sodium
        \<130 mmol/L
-   Large volume paracentesis should be performed for tense ascites or
    refractory ascites (grade 3), regardless of serum Cr. PTs should be
    tapped dry with each paracentesis
-   6-8g of albumin per liter of ascites removed , even if \< 5L
    -   -   So, if 7L removed, you would give 42-56g of albumin
-   Target weight loss of 0.5kg/day when diuresing to avoid renal
    injury  

Refractory Ascites

:

-   Two distinctions:
    -   Diuretic-resistant: lack of response to diuretics (max
        spironolactone 400mg/lasix160mg), Na restriction and rapid
        recurrence following paracentesis
    -   Diuretic-intractable: unable to tolerate diuretic therapy 2/2
        adverse drug effects (unexplained HE, AKI, K abnormalities,
        hypoNa, intractable muscle cramps)
-   Management aside from liver transplant:
    -   Discontinue of diuretics once refractory ascites has been
        established
    -   Consider oral midodrine; can be especially helpful if pt is also
        hypotensive
    -   Serial paracenteses, generally arranged OP with IR
    -   Consider TIPS (trans jugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt;
        has survival benefit)
    -   Following TIPS, cessation or decrease in ascites should occur in
        4-6 weeks
        -   If pt with TIPS presents to hospital with accumulation of
            ascites, can signal that shunt is no longer patent. Obtain
            RUQ w/doppler or CTA abdomen/pelvis to look for patency. May
            require IR study if high enough concern

<!-- -->

-   Medications to avoid or discontinue with refractory ascites:
    -   ACE/ARB,
        NSAIDS,
        β Blockers (
        if Na \<130, systolic \<100, MAP \<65 or AKI)

| Hepatic Hydrothorax |

Background

-   transudative effusion, typically unilateral (right sided); reflects
    ascitic fluid that passes through a small defect in the diaphragm
-   present in 5% of cirrhosis with ascites and portends a poor
    prognosis

Evaluation

-   Often suspected clinically, though must exclude
    pleural/cardiopulmonary process
-   Thoracentesis will demonstrate a transudative effusion and should be
    evaluated with standard pleural fluid lab tests:
    -   Cell count w/ diff
    -   Culture (inoculated at the bedside!)
    -   Protein, albumin, LDH, bilirubin
    -   Other considerations: triglycerides, amylase, cytology

<!-- -->

-   Rule out SBE:
    -   Diagnosed by the following criteria:
        -   Positive pleural fluid culture, PMN>250
        -   Negative pleural fluid culture with PMN >500
        -   No evidence of pneumonia on imaging (to r/o parapneumonic
            effusion)
    -   ½ of cases will present with concomitant SBP

Management

-   Similar management of ascites as noted above
-   AVOID chest-tube placement. Associated with increased morbidity and
    mortality due to extensive loss of fluid, electrolytes and protein
    as well as increased infection risk
    -   Once placed, may be impossible to remove due to constant
        reaccumulation of fluid
    -   PleurX catheters can be considered for palliation (e.g., hospice
        patients)
-   Tension hydrothorax with pronounced dyspnea and hemodynamic
    instability require immediate decompression with thoracentesis
-   Refractory Hydrothorax is defined similarly and managed similarly
    with serial thoracentesis or TIPS. For those who are not candidates,
    consider:
    -   Chemical pleurodesis (fraught w/ complications, not commonly
        performed at VUMC)
    -   Thoracoscopic mesh repair in patients with clear diaphragmatic
        deficits, but again, this is not common practice at VUMC
-   Management of spontaneous bacterial empyema is the same as in SBP,
    as noted below
