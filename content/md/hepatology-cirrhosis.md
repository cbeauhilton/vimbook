| Cirrhosis Overview – Lee Richardson |

Background

-   For any patient admitted with cirrhosis, know the etiology of their
    cirrhosis, whether they are compensated or decompensated, and their
    admission MELD score.
-   Etiology:
    -   Most common causes = Alcohol-associated liver disease,
        non-alcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH) and HCV (becoming less
        common with DAA success)
    -   Less common causes: HBV, metabolic (hemochromatosis, Wilson’s
        disease), A1AT deficiency, autoimmune hepatitis, PSC, PBC,
        veno-occlusive disease, R sided heart disease (congestive
        hepatopathy), and medication-induced
-   Decompensated Cirrhosis:  Cirrhosis + Ascites, Hepatic
    Encephalopathy or Gastroesophageal Variceal Hemorrhage (the presence
    of varices without prior hemorrhage is not decompensation)
    -   Average life expectancy of a patient with compensated cirrhosis
        = 10-13 years
    -   Average life expectancy of a patient with decompensated
        cirrhosis = 2 years

Evaluation

-   Goal is to establish the diagnosis of cirrhosis, determine the cause
    of cirrhosis and determine candidacy and necessary evaluation for
    transplantation.
-   History:
    -   Known history of prior liver disease (if so, from what, and when
        did they learn about it?). Presence/absence of: fatigue, easy
        bruising, lower extremity edema, weight loss, pruritus,
        yellowing of the skin or eyes, increasing abdominal girth, prior
        episodes of disorientation to place, person, or time, sleep
        disturbances.
    -   Extensive social hx including alcohol (start year, quitting
        year, avg amt/day, prior treatment, DUI) and drug use hx (type
        and route plus the above elements in EtOH hx), family history of
        liver disease
-   Physical exam: Splenomegaly, caput medusae, ascites, asterixis/HE,
    conjunctival icterus, spider angiomata, gynecomastia, palmar
    erythema, jaundice, testicular atrophy, easy bruising/bleeding,
    edema/anasarca
-   Labs:
    -   Initial Workup: CMP, CBC, U/A, HCV antibody, HBV panel, iron
        panel (ferritin, transferrin saturation), AFP, Peth
    -   Unless requested by the hepatology team, the following tests can
        be deferred to the OP setting: AMA (PBC), ASMA (AIH), ANA w/
        reflex, IgG, A1AT phenotype, ceruloplasmin (wilson’s), generally
        defer anti-LKM, anti-SLA (type 2 AIH, requires attending
        approval) to Hep recs
-   Imaging:
    -   Abdominal u/s with duplex unless done in past 6 months, or
        indication for repeating (e.g., concern for PVT w/ new EVH)
    -   consider triple phase CTAP (contrasted study that looks at
        arterial and venous phases) vs MRI abdomen w/contrast if
        required by hep team (transplant eval)
    -   HCC surveillance is further discussed below
-   Liver biopsy: Gold standard for diagnosis not always needed if
    clinical picture, labs, and imaging consistent with cirrhosis (See
    Radiology Section for who to consult for biopsy)

Management

-   Malnutrition occurs in 20-60% of patients with cirrhosis
    -   Nutrition consult if ascites present (unless recently done)
    -   High protein (1.2-1.5g/kg) diet
    -   2g Na restriction, reinforce regularly
    -   Consider MVI, folate, thiamine, particularly to pts w/ EtOH Use
        Disorder
    -   Fluid restriction only needed for hyponatremia (as noted below)
-   Ensure pts are up to date on required vaccines; these can be
    administered while inpatient before discharge. Indicated vaccines
    include HBV/HAV, PPSV23, Prevnar, Flu, COVID 19
-   Consider addiction psych (medical therapy) and SW c/s (behavioral
    therapy with IOP, AA) for EtOH use disorder

Additional Information

Lab abnormalities in cirrhosis:

-   Calculate daily MELD-Na scores in pts being considered for Liver
    transplant
-   Coagulopathies: thrombocytopenia (from both hypersplenism and
    increased PLT sequestration and
    ↓
    thrombopoietin production in liver),
    ↓
    coagulation factor production
-   Hyponatremia: Usually hypervolemic hyponatremia in cirrhotic
    patients; benefit from fluid restriction if hyponatremic
-   Hypoalbuminemia: Albumin transfusion is indicated in certain
    scenarios (detailed below) for volume expansion, anti-inflammatory
    and anti-oxidant properties
    -   Order 25% albumin and NOT 5% (5% albumin is only used to
        maintain effective circulating volume following major hepatic
        resection or hepatic transplant)
-   Indications for albumin administration:
    -   SBP (see SBP section)
    -   LVP (see Ascites section)
    -   Diagnosis/Treatment  of HRS (see HRS section)
    -   Hyponatremia (\<125 and not responsive to fluid restriction)
