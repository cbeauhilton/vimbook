| Coagulopathy â€“ Garren Montgomery, John Laurenzano |

Background

-   The liver is responsible for production of both pro- (factor II, V,
    VII, IV, X, and XI) and anti-coagulants (protein C, S) in hemostasis
-   Thrombocytopenia is caused by splenic sequestration 2/2 portal HTN,
    failure to produce thrombopoietin, and bone marrow failure

Evaluation

-   INR, PT, and PTT are poorly reflective of bleeding risk
-   TEG screens and other measures of comprehensive coagulation are more
    representative and are available, but are not universally used at
    VUMC

Management

-   Even in bleeding, there is no need to intervene on an INR or
    platelet value
-   Pre-procedural FFP is not recommended, even in the presence of
    bleeding, but is frequently requested by different proceduralists
-   There is no evidence of benefit, though there is significant risk.
-   Low risk procedures (i.e., paracentesis) do not require
    pre-procedural blood products
-   In bleeding pts, the following are recommended per AASLD and AGA
    guidelines
    -   Vitamin K 10mg x 3 days for those who are cholestatic (poor
        absorption),
    -   FFP: Not recommended, unless as part of a balanced transfusion
        effort to avoid transfusion related coagulopathy, or if a TEG
        screen suggests potential benefit
    -   Cryoprecipitate: if fibrinogen \< 120
    -   Platelets: No specific targets are recommended by the AASLD
        regardless of bleeding. Pre-procedurally the AGA has
        recommended >50.
-   Appropriate DVT ppx should be given in most pts with few exceptions
    (plts \<50k, active variceal hemorrhage)
