| Hepatic Encephalopathy |

Evaluation

-   Asterixis: inability to maintain stable posture; many ways to assess
    -   check for clonus
    -   have pt “hold out hands like you are stopping traffic” (if
        following commands)
    -   place pt in “frog leg” position and observe for flapping
        movement
    -   check for pupillary changes which may herald increased ICP
        (helpful in ICU)

| III   | Marked confusion, arousable but falls asleep, incoherent speech | Asterixis    | \~30% cerebral edema                   |

-   Identify precipitants
    -   Infection (rule out SBP in addition to CXR, BCx, UA/Cx
        regardless of sxs),
    -   Medication non-adherence (lactulose)
    -   GI bleed (perform rectal exam and observe hgb trend)
    -   Over-diuresis resulting in dehydration, lyte abnormalities
        (especially hypoK)
    -   Sedatives/benzo/opiate administration (UDS)
    -   Post-TIPS, other large but spontaneous shunt (imaging can be
        useful to determine if there is a shunt, and if an intervention
        is feasible on such a shunt).
-   Ammonia (NH <sub>3</sub> ) levels do not play a role in the acute
    management of hepatic encephalopathy; if pt has AMS or HE, you will
    treat the HE regardless
-   Arterial NH <sub>3</sub> is used in acute liver failure for
    **prognostication** (not for management)

Management

-   Always determine precipitant and treat underlying condition
-   If GCS \<8 (grade III/IV) transfer to MICU for intubation for airway
    protection. Consider discussing with fellow early in course if
    failing to respond mgmt below
-   Lactulose 30mL TID initially
    -   Titrate dose to at least 4 BMs daily, avoid excessive stool
        output which may exacerbate HE due to dehydration and
        electrolyte abnormalities
    -   Consider lactulose enemas vs DHT placement if pt unable to
        tolerate PO
        -   DHT are **not** contraindicated in patients with esophageal
            varices, but should be avoided in patients with recent
            hemorrhage or banding
        -   Golytely can be substituted for lactulose with DHT in and
            can halve the time to recovery
    -   Add Rifaximin after the second episode of HE, or if failure to
        respond to lactulose
        -   Frequently requires prior auth for OP approval and is
            expensive
        -   Branched chain amino acids (0.25 gm/kg/day, available at
            Walmart) can be considered if unable to take rifaximin and
            recurrent HE (should discuss this w/ attending/fellow)
        -   Rifaximin should be used for primary ppx of HE before and
            following TIPS
        -   Recurrent HE after TIPS:  should investigate and consider
            TIPS constrainment
-   Lactulose is generally continued indefinitely after first episode of
    HE, though discontinuation can be considered if predisposing factors
    (recurrent infection, EVH, EtOH use) have resolved
-   Beware bowel mgmt systems in pts with severe portal HTN and place
    only if necessary
    -   Can disrupt rectal varices and lead to hemorrhage. D/w attending
