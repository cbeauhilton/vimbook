Background

-   Pts with HCV cirrhosis are at greatest risk (incidence 2-4% per
    year)
-   In chronic HBV, pts can develop HCC without having cirrhosis, as can
    patients with NASH

Evaluation

-   Regular screening in pts w/ cirrhosis HCC
-   Also recommended to screen non-cirrhotic with chronic HBV
    -   U/S every 6 months (w/ or w/o AFP)
    -   Routine screening with CT or MRI is not recommended
-   Options If U/S not satisfactory:
    -   CT A/P w/contrast, in comments specify triple phase for HCC
        screening
    -   MRI, specify Gadovist (preferred contrast agent)
    -   Contrast-enhanced ultrasound
-   AFP trend is more useful than 1 value in time **,** though AFP >20
    should prompt multiphase CT or MRI for further evaluation
-   Diagnosis can be made either by imaging (most common) or biopsy
    (rarely).
    -   Triple phase CT demonstrates strong early uptake in arterial
        phase, with subsequent wash-out in portal-venous phase
    -   If diagnosis remains unclear: can surveillance imaging or biopsy
    -   LI-RADS system notes risk of malignancy based on imaging
        characteristics

| LI-RADS      | What does it mean?         | What do we do?                                                                 |
| LR-1 to LR-2 | Definitely/Probably benign | Routine surveillance, consider diagnostic imaging within 6 mos                 |
| LR-3 to LR-4 | Indeterminate/Probably HCC | Repeat or alternative diagnostic imaging in 3-6 mos. Consider Bx for LI-RADS 4 |
| LR-5         | Definitely HCC             | Plan treatment as noted below                                                  |
| LR-M         | Cancer but may not be HCC  | NaN                                                                            |

  

Management

-   Lesions that meet Milan criteria can qualify for MELD exception
    points and are considered transplant candidates
    -   This accounts for pts w/minimal synthetic dysfunction (and
        therefore low MELD)
-   Milan criteria:
    -   Single tumor with diameter >2cm but \<5 cm, no more than 3
        tumors, each \<3 cm
    -   No signs of extra-hepatic involvement or vascular invasion
-   Pts may remain transplant candidates if rx downstages their HCC to
    meet above criteria
-   Liver transplant is definitive treatment, although **resection** can
    also be curative
    -   Favored in pts w/early cirrhosis (Child Pugh A) and HCC amenable
        to resection
-   Locoregional therapies: Pts w/ unresectable disease, or who are not
    surgical candidates

| Radiofrequency ablation                    | If in a favorable location and size, IR can percutaneously ablate with a large needle that emits microwave frequencies  |
| Trans-arterial chemoembolization (TACE)    | Chemotherapeutic agents injected into the tumor to occlude the feeding blood supply to the area.                        |
| Trans-arterial radioembolization (TARE)    | Like TACE, though radioactive compound (i.e. Y-90) used to occlude the feeding blood supply.                            |
| Stereotactic body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) | Radiation therapy: can be used as an alternative to ablation and is generally performed in those meeting Milan criteria |
| Systemic Chemotherapy                      | For metastatic disease                                                                                                  |
