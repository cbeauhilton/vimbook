| AKI & Hepatorenal Syndrome (HRS) – Garren Montgomery |

Background

-   Circulatory dysfunction: Portal HTN causes shear stress on portal
    vessels; endothelium releases vasodilators (NO, prostanoids). This
    causes splanchnic vasodilation and reduced effective blood volume
    (decreased MAP) which activates RAAS and the sympathetic nervous
    system. This results in avid sodium and water retention and severe
    renal vasoconstriction.
-   Inflammation: Bacterial translocation (as seen in SBP) results in
    increased circulating pro-inflammatory cytokines which can worsen
    splanchnic vasodilation and also thought to act directly on proximal
    tubular cells to cause further intrarenal RAAS activation and
    ↓
    GFR
-   Definitions:
    -   HRS-AKI
        (formerly type I HRS): Absolute
        #
        in Cr ≥0.3 mg/dl within 48h OR Percent
        #
        in Cr ≥50% using last available value of outpatient Cr within 3
        months as baseline
        -   HRS-NAKI
            (“non-AKI”): (formerly type II HRS):
        -   HRS-AKD
            : eGFR\<60 for **\<** 3 months in absence of other
            structural causes OR Percent
            #
            in Cr ≤50% using last available Cr over last 3 months as
            baseline
        -   HRS-CKD
            : eGFR\<60 for **≥** 3 months in absence of other
            structural causes
-   Diagnostic Criteria
    -   Presence of cirrhosis with ascites
    -   Diagnosis of AKI (see above)
    -   No response or inadequate response at 48 hrs after volume
        expansion w/ albumin and withdrawal of diuretics
    -   Absence of shock
    -   No current or recent use of nephrotoxic drugs
    -   Absence of proteinuria (\<500 mg/d), absence of hematuria (\<50
        RBCs per HPF), normal renal ultrasound (this criterion would not
        be included if patient has known CKD such as diabetic or
        hypertensive nephropathy)
    -   Suggestion of renal vasoconstriction with FeNa \<0.2, FeUrea
        \<20 (most sensitive diagnostic measure). UNa \<20 is suggestive
        but not diagnostic given baseline sodium avidity in cirrhosis
        and inability to calculate FeNa
    -   Cut off for ATN in cirrhosis is a FeNa >0.5, rather than 1 in
        the general population

Evaluation

-   Step 1: Exclude other obvious causes of renal injury
    -   DDx: Pre-renal (most common), ATN (2 <sup>nd</sup> most common),
        AIN, bile cast nephropathy, IgA nephropathy,
        cryoglobulinemia/MPGN (HCV), membranous nephropathy (HBV), post
        renal (rare)
    -   Common precipitants of AKI: infection, overdiuresis, GI
        bleeding, recent LVP without subsequent volume expansion,
        nephrotoxic drugs/NSAIDs
    -   Workup: BMP, UA w/ microscopy, Urine electrolytes (FeNa,
        FeUrea), urine protein/Cr ratio, renal ultrasound (to assess for
        chronicity)
-   Step 2: Diuretic cessation/albumin challenge
    -   STOP all diuretics, beta blockers, NSAIDs, ACE/ARBs,
        anti-hypertensives, vasodilators, nephrotoxins
    -   START volume expansion with albumin 1g/kg/day (up to a max of
        100 g/day) for 2 consecutive days
    -   Infection is a common precipitant of HRS, assess for ascites and
        perform diagnostic para to r/o SBP
-   Step
    3: Diagnosis of HRS
    -   If no other clear cause of AKI is identified and SCr has not
        improved after 48 hours of diuretic cessation and volume
        expansion proceed promptly to treatment. If suspicion for HRS is
        high, therapy can be started before the 48h mark

Management

-   Pharmacologic therapies: (in order of preference):
-   Terlipressin + albumin. Most effective combo based on clinical
    trials but not yet available in the U.S.
-   Norepinephrine (NE, levophed) + albumin (25-50 g/day).
    -   Most likely to be used at VUMC, requires central access (PICC vs
        triple lumen) but can be administered on stepdown unit/8MCE.
    -   Guidelines recommend NE to be dosed at 0.5-3 mg/hr. Would ask
        fellow, attending or pharmacist for baseline. VUMC protocol for
        ICU and stepdown:
        -   Start NE gtt at 3mcg/min. If UOP is \<200 or MAP \<10mm Hg
            from baseline, increase gtt by 3mcg increments until those
            goals are met or max 20 mcg/min
        -   Albumin will continue to be infused at 50gm per day until
            replete and then stopped or modified depending on decision
            on rounds.
        -   The use of furosemide to supplement volume removal will be
            made on a clinical basis on rounds by the attending and
            resident on service.
-   Continue to hold diuretics. LVP is still generally considered safe
    even in HRS if indicated by tense ascites. This can be attending
    specific and would confirm prior to performing.
-   Therapy is generally continued until HRS is reversed or the
    hepatology attending deems it refractory to medical treatment
-   Complete response to therapy defined as return of SCr within 0.3
    mg/dL of baseline
-   Patients with HRS-NAKI (formerly type II HRS) may respond to the
    above therapies, but recurrence of renal dysfunction after
    withdrawal of vasoconstrictors is the norm and thus current
    guidelines do not recommend them for this scenario
-   TIPS: Generally contraindicated for most HRS pts given high MELD
    scores and not much data to support its use, but may improve renal
    function in patients with HRS-NAKI with refractory ascites
-   RRT: Dialysis can be considered for those who fail to respond to
    pharmacologic therapy, particularly as a bridge to liver transplant.
    Decision to initiate should be individualized
-   Liver transplant: The best and most definitive treatment regardless
    of response to pharmacologic therapy

Prevention of HRS:

-   Ensure that pts receive albumin after LVP and when diagnosed with
    SBP. Ensure pts with cirrhosis with suspected UGIB receive ppx abx
-   Avoid NSAIDs. Stop ACE/ARBs if possible. Stop beta blockers in
    patients with refractory ascites and AKI, hyponatremia or
    hypotension.
