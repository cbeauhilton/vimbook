Background

-   Model
    for End-stage Liver Disease (MELD) score: initially developed to
    predict survival following TIPS placement, though is now used to
    objectively rank patients in terms of priority for liver transplant;
    factors in total bilirubin, creatinine, and INR. An updated version,
    the MELD-Na score, factors in the serum Na as well.
    -   Exception points given for complications like HCC and
        hepatopulmonary syndrome (HPS), leading to score in mid to high
        20’s even if biologic MELD is low
-   Whether
    to list a pt for LT is determined by a multidisciplinary transplant
    committee (if interested, ask fellow/attending if you can sit in on
    meeting)
    -   The United Network for Organ Sharing (UNOS) manages and monitors
        the process.
    -   US is divided into 11 geographic regions; organs are allocated
        within each
    -   Acute liver failure pts take precedence over decompensated
        cirrhosis pts for LT

\* *Advanced age (>70) is not in itself a contraindication but
candidates \> 70 should be almost free of comorbidities to be considered
for LT*

Evaluation (ask upper level or fellow for detailed document)

-   -   -   

-   Determine cause of cirrhosis or acute liver failure, if not done
    already

-   Abdominal CT (triple phase) or MRI (multiphase with contrast) to
    evaluate for hepatic malignancy and vascular anatomy.

-   Infectious workup: TB testing, HIV, RPR, VZV, CMV, EBV, and
    Hepatitis A, B, and C.

-   Cardiac evaluation (typically starts with non-invasive testing; TTE
    plus dobutamine stress echo are preferred). Coronary angiography and
    intervention may be necessary if significant CAD is suggested (pts
    with DM or atherosclerosis on abdominal/carotid imaging) or pts with
    multiple risk factors (e.g. age 45M, FF W), NASH, hx smoking

-   PFT’s

-   Appropriate cancer screenings (colonoscopy, pap smear, MMG, and PSA
    if applicable)

-   DEXA scan

-   Certification of completion of intensive outpatient program (IOP)
    for substance abuse

-   Evaluation by hepatobiliary surgical team after obtaining cross
    sectional imaging

-   Psychosocial evaluation (consult Psychiatry, social work)

-   Both living and deceased donor transplant are offered at VUMC. Donor
    evaluation, however, cannot be started before the potential
    recipient is deemed a candidate
