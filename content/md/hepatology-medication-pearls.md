Pain:

-   General rule is to avoid opioids in cirrhosis as they are largely
    metabolized by the liver and can cause confusion, which may be
    mistakenly attributed to HE
-   Alternative options:
    -   Tylenol (up to 2g/day)
    -   Tramadol 50mg BID or 25 mg q8h generally safe if not responsive
        to Tylenol
    -   Increased risk of seizures and serotonin syndrome (avoid if on
        SSRI/SNRI)
    -   Lidocaine patches for localized pain
    -   Gabapentin, with added benefit of treating alcohol use d/o (up
        to 1200mg daily)
    -   Pregabalin 50mg BID
    -   Nortriptyline 10 mg qHS

Anxiety:

-   Benzo’s should generally be avoided due to their risk for causing
    confusion
    -   If needed for EtOH withdrawal, use lorazepam (Ativan) instead of
        chlordiazepoxide (librium) or diazepam (valium) due to its
        shorter half life
-   Antihistamines such as Hydroxyzine (Atarax) are preferred for prn

Pruritis:

-   Cholestyramine 4g/day titrated up to 4 times daily = 16g/day max
    -   SE: poor taste, bloating, constipation, GI distress
    -   very important NOT to dose around other medications given
        potential for interaction/blocking absorption
-   Sertraline: 50-100 mg/day
-   Antihistamines: Benadryl, doxepin 10 mg qHS
-   Topicals such as sarna lotion
-   Rifampin 150-300 mg/day; second-line agent
    -   Side effects: N/V/D, HA, flushing, thrombocytopenia, turns body
        fluids orange
    -   Be VERY mindful of potential drug/drug interactions with
        Rifampin (there are many); would talk to hepatology
        attending/pharmacist before initiating

Insomnia:

-   Melatonin preferred; Hydroxyzine (12.5mg-25mg); Trazodone (100mg);
    **avoid benzo's**
