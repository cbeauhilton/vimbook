| Portal Vein Thrombosis (PVT) – John Laurenzano |

Background

-   Sluggish flow within the portal system, localized endothelial
    inflammation, and alterations in the coagulation/fibrinolytic
    cascade
-   There is a bidirectional relationship between PVT and
    decompensation, as portal vein thrombosis can worsen decompensation
    (i.e. variceal hemorrhage), though at the same time PVT can result
    from worsening portal HTN and more sluggish flow

Presentation

-   Identified asymptomatically on ultrasound, but can be identified by
    new or worsening decompensation of portal HTN
-   Esophageal variceal hemorrhage—most common decompensating event
    assoc. w/ PVT
-   Intestinal ischemia (abdominal pain, hematochezia)—exceedingly rare
    but assoc. w/significant morbidity and mortality

Evaluation

-   
-   Initial: RUQ with doppler
-   Once identified, should be further assessed with ctriple phase CT or
    MRI w/Gadovist contrast to exclude HCC w/tumor thrombus (excludes
    pts from LT as noted above)
    -   AFP can be an adjunctive test to assess for HCC if significantly
        elevated
-   Pts with newly identified PVT should undergo EGD to evaluate for
    high-risk varices, both for diagnostic and therapeutic
    considerations
-   PVT in pts w/o cirrhosis should prompt evaluation for
    hypercoagulable disorders

Management

-   Individualized and based on risk factors for bleeding; should be
    discussed with the attending/fellow. There is no need for urgent
    anticoagulation in the absence of signs/symptoms of intestinal
    ischemia
-   Anticoagulation with VKA, LMWH, or UFH
    -   DOAC’s not as extensively studied in cirrhosis, but may be
        considered Child A pts
    -   If pt is to be listed for transplant and has normal INR,
        coumadin can give additional MELD points and is more easily
        reversed
-   Anticoagulation is associated with improved recanalization in recent
    PVT (\<6 mos), and may improve post-transplant outcomes in those
    awaiting transplantation; pts with chronic occlusive PVT (>6 mos) or
    with cavernous transformation with collaterals do not generally
    benefit from anticoagulation
-   Pts with high-risk varices should undergo endoscopic management or
    be on BB for ppx for variceal hemorrhage, as noted above
-   TIPS with portal vein recanalization has recently emerged as a
    therapeutic modality for PVT
-   Pts should undergo follow up intermittently with ultrasound imaging
    to assess for recanalization. AC may be stopped if there is failure
    to recanalize.
    -   If pts are not candidates for AC, they'll simply be treated for
        complications of portal HTN
