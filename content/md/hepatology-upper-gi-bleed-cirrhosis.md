# Upper GI Bleed in Cirrhosis
 
Gastroesophageal Varices and Hemorrhage – Patricia Checinski

Background

-   Form due to portosystemic collaterals and enlarge in the setting of
    portal HTN, typically through the coronary and/or short gastric
    veins
-   Mechanistically: intrahepatic resistance to portal flow from
    regenerative nodules and fibrosis, as well as
    #
    intrahepatic vascular tone due to endothelial dysfunction
-   Variceal hemorrhage is the cause of \~ 70% of UGIB in pts with
    portal HTN
-   The risk of mortality with each episode of esophageal variceal
    hemorrhage (EVH) is 15-25%. Recurrence occurs in 60% of patients
    within 1-2 years of the index event

Variceal Screening:

-   Not all pts with cirrhosis require screening. Can be omitted with
    low liver stiffness (on elastography) and with platelets >150;
    otherwise screening is necessary.
-   Compensated cirrhosis w/o varices
    
    EGD q3yr, unless active liver injury (obesity, EtOH use, ongoing
    viral infxn), then q2yr
-   Compensated cirrhosis w/small varices
    
    EGD q2yr unless active liver injury, then q1yr
-   Decompensated cirrhosis with no or small nonbleeding varices
    
    EGD q1yr, and at initial time of decompensation
-   If these pts are on Non-selective
    β
    -blocker (NSBB) for 1º ppx w/HR 55-60, no need to screen

Management (Non-Bleeding Varices)

-   Indicated for medium to large varices or high-risk small varices
    (with red signs)
-   Primary ppx with either NSBB (preferred) or endoscopic band ligation
    (EBL), not both
-   NSBB: decrease hepatic venous pressure gradient (HVPG) and portal
    venous flow by decreasing cardiac output (
    β
    1 blockade) and allowing unopposed alpha-adrenergic activity (
    β
    2 blockade). Start NSBB such as nadolol (given nightly as portal
    pressures are highest at night) or propranolol (BID). Carvedilol has
    been shown to have a greater reduction in portal pressures and may
    be most preferred if tolerated.
    -   -   For 2 º ppx, initiate \~72hr after acute bleed has resolved
            and octreotide discontinued
        -   Titrate dose to reduce resting HR by \~25% (or target HR
            55-60)
        -   Ask pt to check their HR and BP 2-3 days after discharge or
            after clinic visit and contact provider for further
            titration
        -   Discontinue if: hypotension, AKI, SBP or hyponatremia
            (w/refractory ascites)
-   EBL is performed in medium to large varices, any varices with red
    wale marks
-   For secondary ppx, pts should be on BB AND undergo EBL. BB are
    associated with reduced mortality, while EBL is not (EBL does not
    eradicate the HVPG)
-   TIPS should not be used for primary ppx

Management (Variceal Bleeding)

-   Assess severity: tachycardia suggests 10% volume loss, orthostatic
    hypotension 20% volume loss, shock 30% volume loss
-   Place two large-bore IVs (18G or larger), resuscitate w/ blood
    products and albumin
-   If hypotensive, try MAC placement and activate massive transfusion
    protocol (MTP)
-   Consider intubation if need for emergent EGD, change in mental
    status, ongoing hematemesis, concern of ability to protect airway
-   Start octreotide 50 mcg IV bolus followed by continuous infusion of
    50 mcg/h, to be continued for 3 days should EVH be confirmed on
    endoscopy
-   Ceftriaxone 1g IV q24h for SBP prophylaxis (reduced mortality), then
    transition to PO ciprofloxacin for total 7-day course
-   IV protonix 40 mg BID (can dc after EGD if no ulcer)
-   Consult GI or alert fellow for upper endoscopy. Endoscopic therapies
    performed include variceal band ligation and sclerotherapy. EBL is
    more effective than sclerotherapy to control bleeding, sclerotherapy
    is used when ligation is not feasible. Repeat endoscopy if
    re-bleeding occurs after initial successful therapy.
-   Consider balloon tamponade with Blakemore as temporizing measure
    before definitive management. Patient must be intubated before
    placement, and preferably GI should be made aware prior to
    placement.
-   No role for the correction of INR, even in the presence of bleeding
    as excessive blood products and FFP can increase portal pressures
    and cause worsening bleeding
    -   Vitamin K can be given w/
        ↑
        INR, though is unlikely to help in the acute setting
    -   Check Fibrinogen and give cryo if fibrinogen is \<120 given its
        low volume
    -   AASLD does not recommend specific platelet targets during
        variceal hemorrhage
    -   Administer blood products in balanced ratio to avoid transfusion
        related coagulopathy (VUMC MTP is 6:4:1 of RBC:FFP:PLT)
-   Transjugular intrahepatic portosystemic shunt (TIPS) can be
    considered as a rescue therapy for rebleeding or refractory
    bleeding, or occasionally as preemptive therapy,
    -   Order TTE early in course, as well as triple phase CT for
        pre-procedural planning. Duplex of portal and hepatic veins can
        be substituted in the setting of severe AKI
    -   TIPS is relatively contraindicated in pts with elevated MELD,
        evidence of R heart dysfunction, and active or difficult to
        control hepatic encephalopathy
    -   TIPS can be considered “preemptively” if bleeding was controlled
        in pts at high risk of failure or rebleeding (Child B 8-9 with
        active bleeding on prior endoscopy or Child C 10-13 regardless
        of endoscopy findings)
    -   For gastric varices, endoscopic management can be attempted with
        EBL or sclerotherapy. TIPS should be considered early in pts
        with cardiofundal varices, though other interventional options
        are coiling via IR with BATO and BRT
        -   Recent data supports BRTO over glue injection for gastric
            varices
-   Following TIPS placement, there is no need for NSBB or EVL, as the
    TIPS has decompressed the portal system and should be considered
    definitive management.
    -   Recurrent bleeding should prompt investigation of the TIPS
