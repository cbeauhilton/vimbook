# Choosing Wisely
 
Don’t use antimicrobials to treat bacteriuria in non-pregnant adults
unless specific urinary tract symptoms are present. Cohort studies have
found no adverse outcomes for older men or women associated with
asymptomatic bacteriuria.

In pts with low pretest probability of venous thromboembolism (VTE),
order a high-sensitive D-dimer as the initial diagnostic test; don’t
start with imaging.

Don’t prescribe medications for stress ulcer prophylaxis to medical
inpatients unless at high risk for GI complications.

Do not order folate levels at all. In adults, consider folate
supplementation instead of serum folate testing in patients with
macrocytic anemia

Don’t test for Clostridium difficile infection in the absence of
diarrhea. (The lab won’t even run the sample if stool is formed)

Don’t continue antibiotics \> 72 hours

in hospitalized pts unless pt has clear evidence of infection.
