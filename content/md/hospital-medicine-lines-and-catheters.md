# Lines and Catheters
 
Foley Catheter

-   Chronic Foleys generally should be exchanged at time of admission
-   Duration of use is biggest risk factor for CAUTI; consider removal
    on rounds daily
-   Any concern for catheter obstruction (particularly with blood clots)
    should prompt urgent urology consult for irrigation/intervention
    (typically after RN has attempted)

PICC

-   Single lumen: long term ABx, stable IV access with intermittent
    draws
-   Double lumen: special populations (ICU or chemo), TPN w/ lipids
    (incompatible with many IV medications)
-   Risk factors for CLABSI/VTE:
    ↑↑
    duration,
    ↑↑
    number of lumens, left arm, lower extremity
-   Removal at earliest time possible is key to preventing
    complications; patient comfort is not an indication for prolonging
    use

G-Tube

-   Troubleshooting: EGS consult for malposition/not functioning, wound
    consult for skin breakdown
-   G-tube study: 30mL Gastrograffin via tube \[resident often must
    push\], and order KUB
