# Utilization Management
 
Utilization Management (UM)

Facilitates appropriate reimbursement for hospitalized patients. The UM
team reviews each patient’s status daily and a hospitalist representing
UM participates in Huddle at both VU and the VA.

Patient Status: observation (OBS) vs inpatient (IP)

-   OBS: short stays with frequent reassessments to determine IP versus
    discharge
    -   -   May have ongoing treatments (i.e. IV antibiotics, nebs,
            etc.), not only monitoring
        -   Same-day procedures admitted with complications
-   IP: longer stays (>2 midnights) w/ high risk of adverse outcomes,
    inpatient-only procedure, need for inpatient testing, or ICU admits
    -   -   LOS should cross 2 midnights
        -   Do not use for custodial care, patient/physician
            convenience, or “while they are here” expedited workups
        -   Do not change status if Pt dies, leaves AMA, transfers
            hospitals, or opts for hospice
