Histoplasmosis

Background

-   Endemic to Ohio and Mississippi river valley
-   Most commonly presents as pulmonary disease but can be disseminated
    (see below)
-   Pulmonary infiltrate with hilar or mediastinal LAD, hilar or
    mediastinal LAD alone, pulmonary nodule/cavitary lesion, pulmonary
    syndrome with erythema nodosum
-   Differential: tuberculosis, malignancy, sarcoidosis (if considering
    sarcoidosis, rule out histoplasmosis as sarcoidosis treatment can
    induce disseminated histoplasmosis)

Evaluation

-   Antigen (requires attending approval): For acute pulmonary
    histoplasmosis, 65% urine sensitivity, 69% serum sensitivity, and
    83% sensitivity when co-tested. Thus, both serum and urine Ag are
    usually sent together
    -   Lower rates of positivity when disease is localized, versus
        diffuse throughout the lungs or disseminated.
    -   There are relatively high rates of cross-reactivity, where
        histoplasma antigen will be positive with blastomycosis.
-   
-   Serology: Consider Histoplasma Ab if evaluating for pulmonary
    disease
-   Culture: most useful in chronic infections, sensitivity is low in
    acute/localized and may take >6 weeks to grow.
-   Bronchoscopy: If clinical suspicion is high and work up negative,
    consider interventional pulmonology consult for consideration of
    bronchoscopy

Management

-   Outpatient/Mild disease:
    -   Tx not required if symptoms \<4 weeks, initiate if symptomatic
        beyond 4 weeks
    -   Itraconazole: 200mg TID x3 days loading, then BID (adjusted by
        levels which are drawn 2 weeks post-start) for 6-12 weeks
        minimum
    -   Can use oral formulation or capsules (capsules require high
        acidity, give with food consumption or OJ or coke; do not use
        capsules if patient is on H2 blockers/PPI)
    -   Voriconazole, Posaconazole: used if not tolerating itraconazole
        or as salvage therapy
-   Inpatient/Moderate to Severe Disease:
    -   Amphotericin: 1-2 weeks induction, followed by PO itraconazole
        for 12 weeks (total)
    -   Methylprednisolone: help to prevent ARDS with significant lung
        involvement

-   Complications
    :
    Pericarditis, Arthritis/Arthralgias with erythema nodosum, Chronic
    cavitary lesions, Fibrosing mediastinitis, Broncholithiasis

Disseminated

Histoplasmosis:

-   Typically found in immunocompromised populations (HIV, solid organ
    transplant recipient, TNF-alpha treatment). Rare in immunocompetent
    adults
-   Clinical presentations: FUO, weight loss, disseminated LAD,
    cutaneous manifestations, bone marrow suppression/pancytopenia,
    liver enzymes elevation, various solid organ involvement on imaging
    (liver, spleen, adrenals, nodes)
-   Diagnosis:
    -   Antigen: urine, serum, BAL, CSF (urine & serum Ag 97-100&
        sensitivity/specificity in AIDS patients)
    -   Serology: less likely to be positive in immunocompromised host
-   Management
    -   Mild: itraconazole
    -   Moderate to Severe: amphotericin induction followed by
        itraconazole
    -   CNS involvement: amphotericin for 4-6 weeks as induction

Blastomycosis

Background

-   Endemic to Mississippi/Ohio river valley, southern and midwestern
    US, great lakes
-   Pulmonary syndrome: cough, fever, hemoptysis, chest pain, dyspnea
    -   Can result in both an acute or chronic pneumonia, as well as
        ARDS
-   Cutaneous: raised verrucous lesion, varying in color, with irregular
    borders
-   MSK: osteolytic lesion, draining sinus, soft tissue swelling
-   Multi-system: up to 20-40% of cases, most typically lung/skin
    involvement.

Evaluation

-   Culture: typically takes 1-4 weeks
-   Ag: urine >serum. \~90% sensitive, but only 80% specific because of
    cross-reactivity
-   Serology: available, but not very useful because of high degree of
    cross-reactivity

Management

-   Mild pulmonary: PO itraconazole for 6-12 months with loading as
    described above, level at 2 weeks, and with same caveats re:
    capsules
-   Moderate to Severe: induction with Amphotericin, followed by 6-12
    months of PO itraconazole

Candida

Background

-   Oropharyngeal: white plaques in mouth, change in taste, erythema
    without plaques
    -   Usually seen in infants, older adults, immunocompromised host
        (HIV or chemotherapy), inhaled steroid users
-   Esophageal: odynophagia, especially retrosternal pain (AIDS defining
    illness)
-   Vulvovaginitis: itching, burning, vaginal discharge, vulvar
    erythema, vulvar edema, dyspareunia, dysuria
-   Balanitis: painful white plaques with burning and itching on the
    glans penis
-   Mastitis: erythema, tenderness in breast feeding woman.

Management

-   Depends on specifics, but typically nystatin or fluconazole EXCEPT
    *C. glabrata* (proof of fluconazole susceptibility needed) and *C.
    krusei* (intrinsically R to fluconazole)
-   Cx generally not indicated unless complicated pt with extensive tx
    history for *Candida*

Additional Information

-   Disseminated
    disease
    -   Presentation: Primarily immunocompromised populations
        (hematologic malignancies, solid organ transplant recipients,
        receiving chemotherapy, TPN, steroid use, broad spectrum
        antibiotics) and ICU settings (especially, burn, trauma, and
        neonatal)
    -   Diagnosis: Candida in a bacterial blood culture (NEVER
        contaminant). Consider if Candida growth from 2 sites (ie sputum
        and urine)
    -   Start micafungin 100mg IV and consult ID for candidemia or if
        concerned for disseminated disease
