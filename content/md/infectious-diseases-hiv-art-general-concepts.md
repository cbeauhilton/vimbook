# HIV & ART General Concepts
 
HIV/AIDS and ART – Joseph Quintana

Background

-   Why is ART important?
    -   Clear morbidity and mortality benefits across all CD4 counts
    -   Decreases subsequent infections (both common and opportunistic)
    -   Decreased HIV related comorbid conditions and viral reservoirs
    -   Reduced HIV transmission
    -   Long term improvement in immune cell function and activation
    -   Most patients will have their care at Comprehensive care clinic
        (CCC), the Vanderbilt HIV clinic, and these clinicians staff
        Rogers ID and HIV consult service
-   New HIV Diagnosis
    -   ID consult (important for initiation, follow up \[CCC\], social
        work assistance)
    -   ART is indicated for all HIV+ patients, regardless of CD4;
        however, starting ART requires appropriate outpatient follow up
    -   Lab evaluation:
    -   HIV viral load, genotype and resistance testing
    -   T cell subsets (CD4 Count)
    -   HLA\*B5701 testing before using abacavir containing regimen
    -   CBC with differential, CMP, UA
    -   T-Spot
    -   Pregnancy testing
    -   Viral hepatitis serologies
    -   Toxoplasma serologies
    -   Other STI screening (Syphilis, Gonorrhea/chlamydia)
-   Timing of ART initiation
    -   Engage ID, address social barriers, baseline laboratory
        evaluation, arrange follow up
    -   Factors affecting timing
        -   Drug toxicity and interactions, risks for resistance,
            adherence
        -   Barriers to medication adherence (homelessness, substance
            use disorder, behavioral health diagnosis)
        -   Treatment of opportunistic infections may delay initiation
            of ART given associated risk of immune reconstitution
            inflammatory syndrome (IRIS)
        -   Delay ART for several weeks after initiation of therapy for
            cryptococcal meningitis, in which IRIS can be fatal
-   ART plan for overnight admits
    -   Okay to continue home ART, special consideration for:
        -   Pts with hepatic or renal dysfunction, may need dose
            adjustment
        -   If there is concern for non-adherence, can hold morning dose
        -   Can be discussed with ID/outpt provider in the morning
        -   Combination pills may need to be ordered as the separate
            components
-   Common key regimens for initiation
    -   Most regimens consist of an NRTI backbone (2 agents) plus a 3
        <sup>rd</sup> agent
    -   Many patients are started on combination pill regimens,
        including Integrase Inhibitor based regimens: Biktarvy®,
        Triumeq®, dolutegravir + Descovy®
        -   Dolutegravir and bictegravir have high barriers to
            resistance relative to first-generation integrase inhibitors
            elvitegravir and raltegravir
