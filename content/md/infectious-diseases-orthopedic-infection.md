Joint Infection and Osteomyelitis â€“ VASP

Evaluation

-   Blood cultures prior to antibiotics
-   MRI is the most sensitive and specific imaging modality for
    osteomyelitis.
-   Ortho consult for Joint fluid aspirate or bone bx; send for culture
    and send fluid for cell count/differential. Ideally, joint fluid is
    inoculated into BCx bottle to improve recovery
-   Reserve some specimen to allow for cell count/differential and Gram
    stain.

Management

-   Hold antibiotics until culture obtained, if patient is clinically
    stable
-   Osteomyelitis is a 6-week treatment course, can consider early
    transition to oral if good bioavailability and susceptibility.
-   For prosthetic joint infection, procedure/retention of hardware
    determines duration
-   First line empiric: Vancomycin + ciprofloxacin 750mg BID
-   Antimicrobial
    therapy will be guided by culture data, ID consult recommended for
    joint infection treatment due to need for prolonged antibiotic
    therapy
