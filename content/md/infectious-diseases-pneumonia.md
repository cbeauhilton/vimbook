# Pneumonia
 
Pulmonary Infections – VASP, Evan Schwartz

Acute Bronchitis

Background

-   -   -   -   -   

-   1
    -3 wks productive cough, often preceded by URI, may have
    wheezing/rhonchi

-   Distinct from chronic bronchitis (>3 mos of consecutive cough x 2
    consecutive yrs)

-   Distinct from PNA (parenchymal consolidation, fever >100.4F,
    hypoxia, tachypnea)

-   DDx: COVID19, post-nasal drip, GERD, undertreated/new asthma, ACE-i
    induced bradykinin cough, undertreated CHF, acute PE, or new lung
    cancer

-   Typically clinical dx; CXR/labs not necessary unless PNA suspected

Management

-   -   -   -   -   

-   Supportive: lozenges, cough suppressants (guaifenesin or
    dextromethorphan), smoking cessation. Consider albuterol inhaler for
    wheezing

-   No indication
    for antibiotics

Influenza

Background

-   -   -   -   -   

-   Dx often clinical w/cough, sore throat, #sputum/nasal discharge, HA,
    fever, myalgias, and malaise; ± N/V/D. Exam with increased flushing,
    rarely with lower respiratory symptoms

Evaluation

-   -   -   -   -   

-   During flu season: Obtain RPP or dedicated Influenza PCR in pts
    w/immunocompromise, acute hypoxic respiratory failure, respiratory
    distress, worsening of COPD, asthma, CAD/CHF; testing more accurate
    if obtained within 96 hour of symptom onset

-   CXR if concerned for bacterial superinfection

Management

-   -   -   -   -   

-   Antivirals most effective w
    hen given \<48 hours from symptom onset; however,
    recommended
    to be given if symptomatic despite duration

-   Oseltamivir 75mg
    BID x 5 days or peramivir 600mg IV x 1 (needs renal adjustment)

-   Pain and fever: high-dose acetaminophen 1g TID are most effective;
    avoid aspirin,
    especially in children due to risk of Reye syndrome

-   There is
    emerging resistance to amantadine and rimantadine, and are no longer
    employed

Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAP)

Background

-   -   -   -   -   

-   All PNA that does not otherwise meet criteria for Hospital Acquired
    Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48 hours after hospital admission),
    Ventilator Associated Pneumonia (PNA that develops ≥48-72 hours
    after endotracheal intubation), or aspiration PNA

-   Healthcare-associated pneumonia is no longer a clinical entity per
    2016 IDSA guidelines

-   MRSA Risk Factors: recent history, cavitary lesion, post-influenza
    bacterial PNA, pts with IDU, severe hypoxemia requiring intubation

-   Pseudomonas: Double coverage is not indicated in general population;
    LQ has 82% sensitivity so not recommended unless isolate proven
    susceptible

Evaluation

-   Resting pulse oximetry, ± ambulatory pulse oximetry
-   Sputum cultures prior to abx, BCx prior to abx in select groups
    (severe pneumonia, ICU admission, cavitary disease,
    immunosuppression).
-   Rule out flu if the right season, COVID-19, consider RVP if it will
    change management
-   CURB-65 or PSI can aid in decision between outpatient vs inpatient
    therapy
    -   CURB65: Confusion, Uremia (BUN >=19 mg/dL), RR (>30/min),
        BP(\<90/60 mmHg), Age ≥ 65 If ≥ 2, hospitalization is
        recommended.
        -   -   Consider urine pneumococcal Ag, urine Legionella Ag in
                severe CAP and in certain pts (e.g., neutropenia,
                asplenia, obstructive lung disease, hyponatremia,
                diarrhea, or heavy alcohol use); these are performed at
                reference labs and will take several days to return.
            -   CRP, ESR, and pro-calcitonin have not been shown to
                reliably improve outcomes; however, pro-calcitonin \<
                0.25 suggests against bacterial respiratory infection
                and antibiotic discontinuation is encouraged
            -   PA/ lateral CXR to evaluate for and localize infiltrate.
                If immunocompromised, consider CT chest w/o contrast
                (does not improve outcomes)
    -   Lobar Consolidation - likely bacterial
    -   Interstitial Infiltrate - likely atypical vs. viral vs.
        non-infectious
    -   Cavitation - concerning for fungal vs. necrotizing vs.
        mycobacterial

Management

-   -   -   -   -   

-   Duration
    : 5-7 days (at least 5 days and improvement with clinical stability)

Additional

Information

-   -   -   -   -   

-   CTX is generally adequate coverage for aspiration PNA without
    evidence of abscess, empyema, or cavitary lesion on imaging

-   There is low sensitivity of S. pneumoniae to azithromycin (42%) and
    doxycycline (72%), so these should not be used as monotherapy

-   Check for DDI with Linezolid (e.g., SSRI)

Hospital Acquired Pneumonia (HAP) and Ventilator Associated Pneumonia
(VAP)

Background

-   -   -   -   -   

-   HAP: Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after admission

-   VAP: Pneumonia that develops >48 hours after endotracheal intubation

Evaluation

-   -   -   -   -   

-   Cultures of blood, sputum, endotracheal aspirate and/or bronchoscopy
    specimen

-   Consider MRSA nares to help with de-escalation

-   If there is concern for respiratory viruses, influenza, COVID send
    RVP

Management

-   -   -   -   -   

-   Duration: 7 days in uncomplicated cases, although specific pathogens
    (e.g., *Pseudomonas* ) may require longer duration and ID guidance

-   Consider ID consultation if the patient is not clinically improving
    on empiric therapy or if an MDR pathogen grows from culture

-   If no MRSA isolated and pt is improving, consider stopping
    vancomycin ASAP

-   Some concern for nephrotoxicity with combination Vancomycin and
    piperacillin-tazobactam, but data controversial
