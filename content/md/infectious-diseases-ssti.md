Skin and Soft Tissue Infection (SSTI) – VASP

Cellulitis

Background

-   Differential
    : erysipelas, pyomyositis, necrotizing fasciitis, osteomyelitis,
    venous stasis, shingles, gout
-   Pathogens
    : Streptococcus species: Group A (most common), B, C, G,
    Staphylococcus aureus (including MSSA and MRSA)
    -   Think
        Streptococcus if non-purulent, lymphagitis, or erypsipelas, and
        Staphylococcus if purulent (i.e. associated with boil or
        abscess)
-   Unique
    clinical scenarios and associated organisms/organisms to consider:
    -   Dog/cat bite: Pasteurella multicoda, Capnocytophaga canimorsus
    -   Human bite: Eikenella corrodens, oral anaerobes, S. aureus
    -   Fresh water exposure: Aeromonas hydropholia, Plesiomonas
        shigelloides
    -   Salt water exposure: Vibrio vulnificus
    -   Neutropenia, presence of ecthyma: Gram negatives (Pseudomonas
        aeruginosa)
    -   Immunocompromised: Fungal (candida species, Cryptococcus),
        Nocardia, non-tubercular mycobacteria)
    -   Burn patients
        : *Pseudomonas, Acinetobacter, Fusarium*

Evaluation

-   Outline
    border of erythema and obtain urgent surgery consultation if rapid
    spread of infection, crepitus, air in tissues or pain dramatically
    out of proportion to exam
-   Blood
    cultures: ONLY needed if systemic signs/symptoms of infection or
    immunocompromised (most pts will not need Bcx or imaging)
-   Ultrasound
    for underlying abscess
-   CT/MRI w/contrast: if necrotizing fasciitis, pyomyositis or
    osteomyelitis suspected (but should not delay surgical consultation)

Management

-   5
    days
    for uncomplicated; 10-14 days for more extensive/serious infection,
    slow improvement, or if immunosuppressed
-   Anti-
    Staphylococcal
    antibiotics should be provided for purulent cellulitis in addition
    to I&D, if abscess present
-   Clinical appearance may often appear to worsen initially despite
    adequate therapy
-   Always elevate the extremity for more rapid clinical improvement!

Necrotizing Fasciitis

Background

-   Infection
    of the deeper soft tissues that causes necrosis along the muscle
    fascia and overlying subcutaneous fat that is rapidly progressive
    and lethal if not addressed
-   Clinical cues include pain out of proportion to exam, hemorrhagic
    bullae

Evaluation

/Management

-   SURGICAL
    EMERGENCY!
    -   STAT consult respective surgical service for emergent
        debridement (generally EGS, but see Wound Care Section of
        Appendices to confirm)
    -   Imaging does NOT rule out necrotizing fasciitis and should not
        delay these consultations
-   ID
    consult
    -   -   -   -   

    -   Blood cultures, but this should not delay antibiotic
        administration

    -   Contact and droplet precautions x first 24h of abx therapy;
        after this, contact precautions only if draining or contained
        wounds

    -   Vancomycin + either piperacillin-tazobactam 3.375g IV q8h
        extended infusion OR cefepime 2gm IV q8h + clindamycin
        600mg-900mg IV q8h (for antitoxin effects)

    -   Duration
        : Not well defined Continue abx at least until HDS and no
        further surgical debridement is required. Clindamycin may be
        d/c’d when pt not critically ill and s/p first debridement. Plan
        must be determined on a case-by-case basis with ID guidance
