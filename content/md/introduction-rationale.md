# Rationale
 
The aim of this handbook is to provide specific, systems-based guidance
on practice at VUMC and the VA. We hope to provide readers with direct
and actionable guidance, consolidating the combined wisdom of
generations of residents and faculty experts. Topics range from
frequently encountered conditions, high yield pages and specialty
specific conditions, which are all bound together in a single,
standardized, and peer-reviewed handbook.

The Handbook represents a coordinated effort to disseminate details of
our practice in a standardized format. The guidance provided by the
handbook makes legible evidenced based practice as well as the oral
tradition of a resident guiding an intern, or an attending a resident.

We hope that this handbook will inspire confidence and learning, whether
the reader is an intern on July 1 or a senior resident who wishes to
refresh their memory of a topic.
