# Acute Rejection
 
Acute Rejection

-   T cell mediated (Cellular Rejection)
    -   Infiltration of the graft by **lymphocytes** and inflammatory
        cells
    -   Treatment: high dose steroids (methyl pred) is first line (\~ 5
        days <u>+)</u>
        -   Thymoglobulin (polyclonal Ig anti-T cell)
        -   Use depends on severity of rejection
        -   Indicated if Cr fails to improve after steroids
        -   T cell subsets are measured before and during treatment
            until depleted
        -   Tacro target levels are **reset to \~8** if treated for
            acute T cell mediated rejection

-   Antibody Mediated Rejection (ABMR)
    -   Acute tissue injury with circulating donor-specific antibodies
        (DSAs); requires evidence of **antibody-mediated damage**
        -   Igâ€™s deposit and activate complement: key is C4d staining in
            the graft will be strongly positive
    -   Treatment:
        -   IV methyl prednisone (3-5 days)
        -   Plasmapheresis
        -   \+
            IVIG
            -   Followed often by Rituxan before d/c
