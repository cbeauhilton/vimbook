# Approach to CKD
 
Approach to Chronic Kidney Disease – Taylor Riggs

Background

-   Decreased
    kidney function or one or more markers of kidney damage for **3 or
    more months**
-   GFR
    \< 60; Staging helps risk-stratify pts likely to progress or develop
    complications of CKD

<!-- -->

-   -   CKD IIIa: eGFR 45-60
    -   CKD IIIb: eGFR 30-44
    -   CKD IV: eGFR 15-30
    -   CKD V: eGFR \< 15

<!-- -->

-   Markers
    of kidney damage
    -   Albuminuria (albumin:creatinine > 300mg/g or urine
        protein:creatinine > 500mg/g)
    -   Urine sediment: RBC cases, WBC casts, oval fat bodies or fatty
        casts, granular casts
    -   Electrolytes or other abnormalities due to tubular disorders
    -   Abnormalities on histology (glomerular, vascular or cystic
        disease, TIN)
    -   Structural abnormalities: (cysts, hydronephrosis, scarring,
        masses, renal artery stenosis)
    -   History of kidney transplant (rejection, drug toxicity 2/2
        calcineurin inhibitors, BK virus nephropathy, recurrent disease
        leading to transplant)
-   Refer
    to AKI section for a detailed list of etiologies

When to refer to nephrology clinic

-   eGFR
    \< 30
-   Persistent
    urine albumin/creatinine ratio > 300 mg/g
-   Urine protein/creatinine ratio greater than 500 mg/g
-   Rapid
    loss of kidney function (> 30% decline over 4 months)
-   Hematuria not 2/2 urologic condition or RBC casts
-   Inability
    to identify presumed cause of renal dysfunction
-   Difficult
    to manage complications (hyperkalemia, anemia, bone-mineral disease,
    HTN)
-   Confirmed
    or presumed hereditary kidney disease (PCKD suspected)

Albuminuria

-   Microalbuminuria
    : 30-300 mg/day
-   Macroalbuminuria
    : > 300 mg/day (UA typically only detects these pts)
    -   In patients with albuminuria found on UA, confirm albuminuria
        with 2 repeat tests over 3-6 months. Early morning void sample
        is best. Ensure patient does not have UTI, fever, recent IV
        contrast, hematuria, or alkaline urine.
    -   After confirmation, monitor annually.
    -   For patients with CKD or DM but without albuminuria, monitor
        annually for development of albuminuria
-   Treatment
    : reducing proteinuria can slow the progression of renal disease
    -   ACEi/ARBs: reduce intraglomerular pressure, thereby reducing
        proteinuria
    -   Work over weeks to months. Not as rapid as anti-HTN effect.
    -   Goal is to titrate ACEi/ARB to BP \< 130/90
    -   Most effective when used in conjunction with low Na diet
        (\<2g/d) +/- diuretics
-   Can
    add other anti-hypertensives to achieve goal BP if ACEi/ARB alone
    not able to be tolerated due to side effects (e.g. hyperkalemia)

Metabolic acidosis

-   Goal
    bicarbonate: 23-30
-   Can
    calculate bicarbonate deficit (MDcalc has calculator) and use that
    to estimate dose
-   If
    bicarb
    \< 22, consider starting:
    -   Sodium bicarb 650 mg TID (8mEq bicarb per 650mg tablet). Can
        titrate up to 5850mg/day (70 mEq or 3 tabs TID)
    -   Sodium citrate (bicitra): 1mL = 1 mEq
    -   Baking soda: 1 teaspoon = 59 mEq HCO3 (often well-tolerated by
        patient compared to bicitra in terms of taste)

HTN in CKD

-   Goal
    BP \< 130/80
-   CKD
    stage 1 or 2 without albuminuria or DM:
    -   Usual first line BP medications (ACEi/ARB, CCB, or HCTZ)
-   CKD
    stage 3 or greater
    -   ACEi or ARB is first line
    -   Can add diuretics to ACEi/ARB for adjunctive therapy in CKD 4-5
    -   HCTZ not effective with eGFR \< 30
    -   Low sodium diet effective in volume and BP control
-   Consider
    stopping ACEi/ARB if:
    -   GFR declines >30% over 4 months and consider evaluation for
        renal artery stenosis with Duplex Doppler renal u/s vs CTA or
        MRA as initial screening
    -   K > 5.5 despite efforts to decrease potassium (i.e. low K diet,
        optimizing dose of diuretics, adding K-binders)
    -   If patient has an AKI on CKD, especially if pre-renal

Anemia in CKD

-   Etiology
    : reduced EPO, chronic inflammation, uremic platelets/platelet
    dysfunction, loss of blood in dialysis circuit
-   Indications
    for iron supplementation in non-dialysis patients:
    -   ALL patients with TSAT \<20% and ferritin \<100 ng/mL
    -   Patients with Hb \<13 and TSAT \<30% and ferritin \<500 ng/mL
    -   Can consider oral iron supplementation unless severe anemia or
        iron deficiency
    -   PO Iron dosing: New evidence shows that every other day oral
        iron leads to increased absorption and efficacy and decreased
        side effects
        -   -   Ferrous sulfate 325mg (65mg elemental iron) every other
                day
            -   Reassess iron levels in 1-3 mos; if not appropriately
                ↑
                , consider IV iron repletion
    -   IV Fe dosing: 1000 mg IV, either via 1 dose or multiple doses
        depending on formulation
        -   -   Ferric gluconate: max dose 250 mg over 1 hr, dosed
                weekly for 3-4 doses
            -   Iron dextran: 1000
                mg in a single dose, infused over one hour (less
                preferred due to
                higher risk of allergic reactions; requires te
                s
                t dose 5 min prior)
-   Dialysis
    patients:
    -   IV Iron preferred method of repletion for HD patients with
        -   -   TSAT \< 20% and ferritin \< 200
            -   TSAT \<30
                % and ferritin \<500 AND with Hb \< 10 OR are on EPO
    -   Dosing: usually administered at HD sessions
        -   -   125 mg ferric gluconate at consecutive HD sessions x 8
                doses
            -   100 mg iron sucrose at consecutive HD sessions x 10
                doses
            -   Ferumoxytol 510mg at the end of two HD sessions 1-4
                weeks apart
-   Indications
    for EPO
    -   Pts w/ Hb \<10 who are not iron deficient or who’s anemia
        persists despite adequate iron repletion

Hyperkalemia (Goal K \< 5.5)

-   Generally
    , only develops in patients who are oliguric or with other problems,
    such as high K diet or hypoaldosteronism (due to ACEi/ARB)
    -   Low K diet (\< 40-70 mEq/day or 1500-2700 mg/day)
    -   Add loop diuretics if hypertensive or hypervolemic; Can use
        thiazide if GFR > 30
    -   GI cation exchangers: work within hours
        -   -   Patiromer (Veltassa): binds K in colon in exchange for
                calcium
            -   Sodium zirconium cyclosilicate (Lokelma): binds K
                throughout intestine in exchange for sodium and H
                <sup>+</sup>
            -   Need nephrology
                attending approval for Lokelma
    -   Do not use Kayexelate as chronic therapy
    -   Ensure acidosis is treated due to resulting extracellular K
        <sup>+</sup> shift (see next section)
    -   Consider discontinuing ACEi/ARB if K persistently > 5.5

Mineral bone disease in ESRD

-   Ca goal: \< 9.5. Avoid supplementation in mild or asymptomatic
    hypocalcemia
-   Vit D25 goal: > 20. Replete as in normal population
-   Phos
    goal: \< 5.5. Start phosphate binders (sevelamer or noncalcium-based
    binders typically preferred) with goal Phos 3.5-5.5
    -   Sevelamer: use lowest dose effective to achieve Phos \< 5.5
        -   -   Phos 5.5-7.5: initial dose 800 TID with meals
            -   Phos 7.5-9.0: initial dose 1200-1600 TID with meals
            -   Phos > 9: initial dose 1600 TID
            -   Can titrate
                dosing by 400 to 800 mg per meal at 2 week intervals
    -   Restrict dietary phos to 900 mg/day
-   PTH
    goal: 2-9 x ULN, although exact goal unknown in assessing renal bone
    disease. Treatment involves calcimemetics, calcitriol, and synthetic
    vitamin D analogues.

Diabetes in CKD

-   A1c
    goal:
    -   \< 7% in patients with long lifespan, few comorbidities, and
        minimal hypoglycemia
    -   \< 8% in patients with multiple comorbidities and frequent/high
        risk for hypoglycemia
-   Treatment
    :
    -   Metformin remains first-line but should be dose-reduced based on
        eGFR
        -   -   eGFR > 45: Maximum daily dose of 2000mg/day (1000mg bid)
            -   eGFR \< 45: Reduce max daily dose to 1000mg/day (500mg
                bid)
            -   eGFR \< 30: Discontinue
    -   SGLT-2 inhibitors for patients with eGFR > 30 reduces
        progression to ESRD and death from renal or cardiovascular
        causes

Dialysis initiation

-   Dialysis
    education is usually started once patients are in CKD IV with eGFR
    15-30, so earlier referral to nephrology may be helpful in patients
    with eGFR 30-45 who you think may be heading towards eGFR \<30
-   Late
    referral to a nephrologist (ie, less than three months before the
    start of dialysis therapy) is associated with higher mortality after
    the initiation of dialysis
