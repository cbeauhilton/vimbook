Common Side Effects of Renal Transplant Immune Suppressants

Tacrolimus

-   Toxicity
    mediated by vasoconstriction to the afferent arterioles
-   Symptoms
    /signs: Hand tremors, headache, nausea, thrombotic microangiopathy,
    hyperkalemia
-   Calcium
    channel blockers can prevent the
    ↑
    renal vasoconstriction thus most transplant patients with HTN are on
    dihydropyridine CCBs

Mycophenolate

-   Symptoms
    /signs: diarrhea, abdominal pain, nausea, leukopenia, anemia,
    thrombocytopenia, tremor
-   Can cause microscopic colitis

Diarrhea

-   Common
    SE in patients on Mycophenolate and Tacro \[common regimen\]
    -   Diarrhea \[usually severe\] can precede Tacro toxicity
        -   Diarrhea causes increased Tacro levels due to
            ↑
            absorption and
            ↓
            intraluminal metabolism
    -   Mechanism
        -   ↓
            enzymatic activity of the CYP3A system + P-glycopeptide in
            enterocytes damaged by inflammation and infection lead to
            decreased intraluminal tacro metabolism

Additional Information for Overnight Admits:

-   Transplant
    teams do not want the night team to change transplant medications
    overnight
-   Exception
    : If pt has severe diarrhea, can hold night tacro dose and inform
    the day team
-   Ensure the pt gets a daily tacrolimus level (order q am at 5:00).
    Always order tacrolimus dose at 6:00 am and 6:00 pm (regardless of
    what time patient takes at home, lab can only run am tacro levels at
    a certain time in batches)
-   EXCEPTION
    : If late afternoon admission, consider paging the fellow (since its
    early) and ask if they want the evening dose held until the am level
    comes back
-   Transplant patients with normal kidney function can have regular
    diet
