# Hyperkalemia
 
Hyperkalemia – Mengyao Tang, Amanda Morrison

Background

-   Causes: excessive intake (iatrogenic, supplementation), insufficient
    loss (CKD, AKI, type IV RTA, adrenal insufficiency, intracellular
    release or shifts (rhabdo, TLS, acidosis)
-   Medication-related: ACEi, ARB, MRA, NSAIDs, TMP/SMX, digoxin,
    heparin
-   “Pseudo”: hemolysis, severe leukocytosis, hand exercises w/
    tourniquet on during labdraw
-   Can be asymptomatic, or develop parasthesias, hyporeflexia, muscle
    weakness, GI upset

Evaluation

-   Confirm it is real: check for hemolysis, repeat BMP
-   Check EKG for hyperkalemic changes
    -   -   K <sup>+</sup> 5.5-6.5:  peaked T waves, prolonged PR
            interval
        -   K <sup>+</sup> 6.5-8: prolonged QRS, loss of P wave, ST
            elevation, ectopic beats
        -   K <sup>+</sup> >8: sine wave pattern, asystole, PEA, VF
-   To establish cause once confirmed:
    -   -   Labs: CBC with diff, UA, urine electrolytes, Mg, VBG
            -   Also consider LDH, haptoglobin, uric acid, CK
        -   Imaging: bladder scan, renal ultrasound

Management

-   If there are EKG changes
    -   -   Calcium gluconate 1g IV (effective within 3-5 min)
            -   Stabilizes cardiac membrane for \~60mins
            -   SHOULD BE REPEATED HOURLY while Hyperkalemic
-   Correct acidosis: Can use NaHCO3 dosed based on bicarb deficit
-   Shift
    K <sup>+</sup>
    Intracellularly
    -   -   D50 w/ regular insulin 10 units (can order using Adult
            Hyperkalemia order set in epic)
            -   Consider using 5 units if there is renal impairment
            -   Lasts for 4-6hrs (can be longer in renal impairment)
        -   Beta Agonists (e.g. high-dose albuterol nebulizer); lasts
            2-4 hrs
-   Increase
    K <sup>+</sup>
    Excretion
    -   -   Loop diuretic (e.g. lasix)
            -   If there is AKI or a volume deficit can administer with
                IVF (Don’t dry out an already dry patient! Sometimes a
                dry patient only needs fluids to start kaliuresis)
            -   Kayexalate 60g PO q2h until bowel movement (If using
                oral, ensure patient is having bowel movements and is
                not obstructed, could cause bowel injury/ necrosis)
                -   PO can take up to 2hrs to work
                -   Strongly consider per rectal administration for
                    quicker onset of action or if unable to tolerate PO
                    -   DO NOT GIVE WITH SORBITOL per rectum

<!-- -->

-   Hemodialysis
    -   -   Can correct K <sup>+</sup> rapidly but will take time to set
            up, especially if pt does not have access
        -   Consult nephrology early if severe hyper K <sup>+</sup> or
            concerned that pt will not respond
