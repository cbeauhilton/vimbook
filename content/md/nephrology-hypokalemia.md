# Hypokalemia
 
Hypokalemia â€“ Peter Thorne/Patrick Steadman

Background

-   Potassium (K <sup>+</sup> ) \< 3.5 mEq/L
-   98% of total body K <sup>+</sup> is intracellular (majority in
    muscle cells)
-   Goal: prevent life threatening complication (e.g. arrhythmia),
    replace deficit, elucidate cause
-   Insulin and catecholamines (Beta adrenoreceptors) are key drivers of
    transcellular shifts
-   H+ and K <sup>+</sup> will trade places to maintain
    electroneutrality

Presentation

-   Malaise, weakness, myalgias, decreased gastrointestinal motility
-   EKG changes:
    -   Mild: ST segment depression, decreased T wave amplitude
    -   Severe: U-waves (most commonly seen in precordial leads V2 and
        V3)
-   Severe hypokalemia can lead to rhabdomyolysis

Evaluation

-   History: Consider decreased
    K <sup>+</sup>
    intake, increased entry into cells (ex: Increased cell production,
    elevated beta-adrenergic activity, hypothermia), GI losses, urinary
    losses (diuretics, hypomagnesemia, RTA, tubular defects,
    hyperaldosteronism)
-   If concomitant metabolic alkalosis: Normal/low BP suggests diuretic
    use, vomiting or Gitelman/Bartter syndromes
-   Hypertension suggests renovascular disease or primary
    mineralocorticoid excess
-   Labs: BMP, CBC, VBG, urine electrolytes, magnesium, POC glucose, CK
-   Imaging: Renal US, CT A/P
-   Other: aldosterone, renin, cortisol

Management

-   Check Mg <sup>+2</sup> , replete to 2; Give empirically while
    waiting for serum Mg <sup>+2</sup>
-   K <sup>+</sup>
    preparation (route); replete to 4
-   Choice of agent:
    -   KCl is used for repletion in the hospital
        -   -   PO tablets for mild asymptomatic hypokalemia
            -   IV can be given through peripheral (
                rate is 10mEq/hr)
                or central access
    -   K <sup>+</sup> bicarbonate can be dissolved and put through G
        tube
        -   -   Useful in pts with hypokalemia and metabolic acidosis
    -   K <sup>+</sup> acetate is given IV, rarely used (often additive
        to TPN)
-   Dose:
    -   Normal renal function: 10 mEq K <sup>+</sup> is expected to
        raise serum \[K <sup>+</sup> \] by 0.1 mEq/L
    -   Significant CKD or AKI: at risk of overcorrection
        -   -   Shortcut: multiply the mEq by the Cr = how much
                K <sup>+</sup>
                expected to rise
    -   Once
        K <sup>+</sup>
        higher than 5.5,
        K <sup>+</sup>
        increases much faster and rules above do not apply
