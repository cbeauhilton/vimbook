# Hypomagnesemia
 
Hypomagnesemia – Mike Tozier

Background

-   Serum Magnesium (Mg <sup>+2</sup> ) \< 1.8 mg/dL, most pts
    asymptomatic until \<1.2 mg/dL
    -   -   Severe \[
            Mg <sup>+2</sup> \] \< 1 mg/dL
-   Causes
    -   -   GI: Diarrhea, malabsorption, acute pancreatitis, EtOH use,
            terminal cancer, TPN, vomiting, NG suction, GI fistulas,
            anorexia, short gut syndrome, small bowel bypass
        -   Drugs: PPIs, loop diuretics, thiazides, digoxin,
            amphotericin, aminoglycosides, foscarnet, cisplatin,
            cetuximab, CNIs, laxatives, pentamidine
        -   Renal: ATN recovery, transplant, others genetic or drugs as
            listed elsewhere
        -   Extracellular->Intracellular shift: DKA treatment/recovery,
            refeeding, hungry bone syndrome, correction of metabolic
            acidosis, pancreatitis, EtOH withdrawal
        -   Genetic: Gittleman, Bartter, multiple other rare conditions
        -   Other: DM, hyperCa, hyperthyroid, hyperaldosteronism, burns,
            lactation, Vit D deficiency, heat, prolonged exercise,
            mitral valve prolapse, pseudohypomagnesemia 2/2 EDTA tube,
            lactation

Presentation

-   Consider in ICU pts, refractory hypocalcemia or hypokalemia, heart
    failure, any arrhythmia, chronic diarrhea/GI losses, refeeding, pts
    on PPIs or diuretics
-   Initial symptoms: nausea, vomiting, appetite loss, fatigue,
    weakness, paresthesia’s, contractions, cramps, depression,
    agitation, psychosis, dysphagia
-   Severe symptoms: seizures, drowsiness, confusion, coma, arrhythmias
-   Vertical nystagmus, tetany (Chvostek sign, Trousseau), tremors,
    fasciculations, seizures
-   EKG: Initially wide QRS, peaked Ts. Progresses to wide PR,
    diminished T, arrhythmias
-   Other labs: Ca <sup>+2</sup> , K <sup>+</sup> , can use FE
    Mg <sup>+2</sup>
    (order urine
    Mg <sup>+2</sup>
    and Cr, serum Cr and
    Mg <sup>+2</sup>
    ) or 24-hour urine for
    Mg <sup>+2</sup>
    to distinguish renal vs GI etiology (FE
    Mg <sup>+2</sup>
    \>2% renal, \<2% GI)
-   Urine studies need to be done when pt at steady state, if checked
    shortly after IV magnesium given you will see elevated magnesium
    excretion no matter the cause

Management

-   Correct
    underlying cause, replete based on severity (Dosing below for normal
    GFR)
-   Oral
    : asymptomatic pts, can cause GI symptoms, not well absorbed
    -   -   Sustained release (
            Mg <sup>+2</sup>
            Chloride or
            Mg <sup>+2</sup>
            L-lactate) better tolerated and absorbed, though standard
            preparations (
            Mg <sup>+2</sup>
            oxide) are faster acting
        -   Mg <sup>+2</sup>
            chloride: 3-4 tabs BID (total 30 to 56 meq \[15 to 28
            mmol\]) for severe hypo
            Mg <sup>+2</sup>
        -   2-4 tabs daily (total 10 to 28 meq \[5 to 14 mmol\]) for
            mild hypo
            Mg <sup>+2</sup>
        -   Mg <sup>+2</sup>
            oxide: 400-800 mg BID (20 to 40 mmol \[40 to 80 meq\]) for
            mod-severe hypo
            Mg <sup>+2</sup>
-   Intravenous
    : for symptomatic patients or if GI intolerance to oral
    -   -   Mg <sup>+2</sup>
            \<1 mg/dL: 4 to 8g of MgSO4 (32 to 64 meq \[16 to 32 mmol\])
            over 12 to 24 hrs
        -   Mg <sup>+2</sup>
            1 to 1.5 mg/dL: 4 g MgSO4 (16 to 32 meq \[8 to 16 mmol\])
            over 4 to 12 hrs
        -   Mg <sup>+2</sup>
            1.6 to 1.9 give 1 to 2 grams MgSO4 (8 to 16 meq \[4 to 8
            mmol\]) 1-2 hrs
        -   VUMC only has 4g bags of IV mag so would need to ask nurses
            to only infuse 1/2 bag
        -   Infusion rate should not exceed 2 g/hr to minimize urinary
            excretion

Additional Information

-   Renal impairment: replete with caution, reduce dose by 50-75% and
    monitor closely
-   If persistent hypo
    Mg <sup>+2</sup>
    in pts requiring diuresis, try K-sparing diuretic (e.g. Amiloride)
-   Treat concomitant hypokalemia, hypocalcemia or hypophosphatemia
-   In pts with concomitant hypophos and hypocalcemia, IV
    Mg <sup>+2</sup>
    alone -> worse hypophos
