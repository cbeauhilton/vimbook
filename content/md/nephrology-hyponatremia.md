# Hyponatremia
 
Hyponatremia – Kaitlyn Reasoner

Background

-   Definition: Serum Na <sup>+</sup> \<135 mEq/L. A problem of excess
    free water.
-   Can
    be due to
    ↑
    water intake or
    ↑
    ADH release
-   ADH
    is released in response to
    ↑
    serum osm or
    ↓
    volume (low cardiac output can also look like low volume to the
    body, e.g. heart failure exacerbation)
-   The
    body will protect volume over preserving a normal osmolarity and ADH
    will be released for low
    volume/low CO despite a low osm
-   Herniation almost exclusively occurs in acute settings including
    large volume H2O ingestion (ecstasy usage, runners, psychogenic),
    post-op, intracranial pathology
-   Severity:
    -   Mild
        :
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        130-134
    -   Moderate
        :
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        125-129
    -   Severe
        :
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        \<125

Presentation

-   Mild to moderate symptoms include lethargy, N/V, dizziness,
    confusion, fatigue, cramping
-   Severe
    symptoms
    include obtundation, coma, respiratory arrest, seizure.

Evaluation/Management

-   Rule
    out pseudohyponatremia, review meds and infusions (often hypotonic)
    -   If pt also has hypokalemia, correcting the K <sup>+</sup> will
        also increase the
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        and this must
        be taken into account when calculating the amount of
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        needed
-   Step 1:
    Rule out pseudohyponatremia
    -   Causes of pseudohyponatremia include hyperglycemia (most
        common), sorbitol, mannitol, sucrose, elevated lipids, TSH, or
        protein
    -   Check glucose, TSH, lipids, and protein level
    -   If hyperglycemic
        , corrected serum
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        = measured
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        \+ 1.6\*\[(glucose – 100)/100\]
        -   -   If corrected
                Na <sup>+</sup>
                is normal, treat hyperglycemia; there is not a water
                balance problem
            -   If corrected
                Na <sup>+</sup>
                is low, there is hypotonic hyponatremia + coexisting
                hyperglycemia
-   Step 2:
    Determine if ADH is high or low and treat accordingly
    -   Send urine osm and urine
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        at the same time you send serum osm
    -   High ADH
        =
        ↑
        urine osm or urine osm>serum osm
    -   Low ADH
        , high free water intake =
        ↓
        urine osm or urine osm\< serum osm
        -   -   Causes: primary polydipsia, beer potomania, tea & toast
            -   Treatment **:** restrict free water

<!-- -->

-   Step 3:
    If ADH is high, determine if it is **appropriate** versus
    **inappropriate** elevation
    -   Appropriate
        ADH is due to
        ↓
        actual/perceived
        circulatory volume or
        ↓
        cardiac output
        -   -   Causes:  hypovolemia, cirrhosis, heart failure/
                ↓
                CO, nephrotic syndrome, salt wasting (HCTZ, cerebral,
                SSRIs, etc.)
            -   Urine
                Na <sup>+</sup>
                usually \<30 mmol
            -   Treatment: Stop offending medications & Correct volume
                perturbation
    -   Inappropriate
        ADH
        ↑
        , euvolemic or
        ↑
        ADH out of proportion to stimulus, urine
        Na <sup>+</sup>
        \>30
        -   -   Causes: SIADH (malignancy, meds, surgery, pulmonary
                disease, hormones, pain, or bladder distension)
            -   Treatment: water restriction, can add NaCl tabs or urea
                if fluid restriction is severe
            -   Calculate Water
                restriction for SIADH (L per day) = 600 / Urine osm
                -   600 is the
                    average salt meq in an American diet per day

Additional Information

Consider nephrology consult if:

-   Considering ddAVP clamp for overcorrection, or suspect this will
    happen, PO urea (a non-sodium osmole), Lasix if appropriate,
    vaptans, salt tablets
-   ICU care for pts with serum
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    \<120
-   Pts at high risk for osmotic demyelination: chronic liver disease,
    chronic alcohol use, concurrent
    hypokalemia, malnourishment, serum sodium \<105

Acute (\<48 hrs)

-   If severe or symptomatic + not autocorrecting, give 50 cc bolus 3%
    NaCl (HTS)
-   Monitor
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    q1-2 hr
-   Goal is an initial rapid 4-6 mEq/L correction and then hold
    -   May
        require Hypertonic Saline
        infusion

Chronic (>48 hrs or unknown, higher risk for osmotic demyelination if
corrected too quickly):

-   Goal
    Na <sup>+</sup>
    correction rate 4-6 mEq/L over 24 hrs (Max 8mEq/L)
    -   8 mEq/L per 24 hrs thereafter
-   If severe, proceed
    as under acute above
