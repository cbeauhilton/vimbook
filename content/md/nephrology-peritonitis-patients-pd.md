# Peritonitis in patients on PD
 
Peritonitis in patients on PD

Background

-   Etiology
    likely 2/2 contamination with pathogenic skin bacteria during
    exchanges or due to exit-site or tunnel infection
-   Usually present with cloudy effluent fluid and abdominal pain but
    can be present even in the absence of one of these
-   Important
    history to obtain: recent contamination, accidental disconnection,
    endoscopic or gynecologic procedure, as well as the presence of
    constipation or diarrhea
-   Definitive
    diagnosis requires 2 of the following:
    -   Clinical features consistent with peritonitis
    -   Positive dialysis effluent culture
    -   Dialysis effluent with WBC > 100 with PMN > 50%
        -   -   Even
                if WBC count \< 100, presence of > 50% PMNs is still
                strong evidence of peritonitis in pts with rapid cycle
                PD

Evaluation

-   Culture
    peritoneal fluid (requires training and equipment, performed by
    Nephrology)
-   Peritoneal
    cell count with diff, gram stain and culture
-   Obtain
    peripheral blood cultures if there is concern for sepsis

Management

-   All
    PD orders, intraperitoneal antibiotics, and prescription adjustments
    should be directed by ESRD consult service (page them overnight if
    concerns)
-   Treatment
    with intraperitoneal antibiotics should be started immediately after
    specimens have been obtained if there is high clinical suspicion
-   Empiric
    antibiotics regimen should cover both gram positive and gram
    negative organisms, typically with Vanc and third generation
    Cephalosporin
-   Systemic
    antibiotics are generally not necessary unless pts have systemic
    signs of sepsis
-   Pts
    with relapsing, recurrent or repeat peritonitis will likely need
    catheter removal

Secondary prevention

-   Treatment
    with intraperitoneal OR IV antibiotics (for any infection
    requiring > 1 dose of antibiotics) requires prophylaxis for fungal
    peritonitis with either:
    -   Nystatin 400,000 to 500,000 units orally TID
    -   Fluconazole 200 mg every other day or 100 mg qdaily
-   Dialysate
    should be drained the day of endoscopies or gynecological procedures
