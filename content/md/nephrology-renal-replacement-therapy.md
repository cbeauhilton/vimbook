Renal Replacement Therapy â€“ Joseph Quintana, David Li, Taylor Riggs

Indications

for Acute Renal Replacement Therapy \[

AEIOU

\]

-   Acidosis
    : intractable severe pH \<7.1 <u>and</u> hypervolemia
    -   Unless
        acidemia quickly reversible like DKA
-   Electrolytes:
    K, Na, Ca, Phos, Uric acid which are unable to correct by
    noninvasive or temporizing measures
    -   Hyperkalemia
        : >6.5 mEq/L, cardiac changes, warrant urgent dialysis;
        Temporize them until dialysis (insulin D5/D50, IV calcium,
        albuterol, potassium binders)
-   Intoxication
    : methanol, ethylene glycol, Lithium, ASA
-   Overload
    : fluid overload, particularly hypervolemia and pulmonary edema, and
    particularly with renal failure (AKI or ESRD)
    -   Try IV Lasix challenge 240 mg IV (if >200 mL in 2 hrs urine,
        then no need for dialysis);
        -   Can discuss sequential nephron blockade with nephrology
    -   If anuric w/o pulmonary edema: nephrology will give things 24
        hours to settle out
-   Uremia
    : pericarditis, seizure, functional platelet dysfunction in advance
    of a pending procedure, or decline in mental status

ESRD Admits

-   Consult
    ESRD in the morning for routine dialysis unless more urgently needed
-   Routine
    orders include MWF phos checks and Renal diet
-   For
    peritoneal dialysis pts, their diet can be more liberal and include
    low phos only or even regular diet (Can just ask what diet he/she
    follows at home)
