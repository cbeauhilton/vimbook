UTI in Renal Transplant

Background

-   Most
    common post-renal transplant infection
-   Associated
    with increased risk of rejection, allograft dysfunction and
    morbidity/mortality
-   Risk
    Factors
    /Unique Considerations for Transplant Patients:
    -   Vesicoureteral
        reflex is common in transplant patients due to short transplant
        ureter and no valve at vesicoureteral junction
    -   Native
        kidneys/ureteral stumps (particularly if history of PKD), renal
        calculi, urinary tract abnormalities such as vesicoureteral
        reflex
    -   Catheterization or indwelling urinary stents, defunctionalized
        bladder (related to prior oliguria/prolonged dialysis), deceased
        donor transplant, delayed graft function, transplant
        immunosuppression and/or systemic illness on steroids and
        immunosuppression (may mask symptoms of sepsis)
-   Common
    organisms:
    -   GNRs: E. Coli most common, Pseudomonas, Enterococcus, Klebsiella
    -   Increasing resistance to ciprofloxacin and Bactrim due to
        frequent use for prophylaxis
-   Prevention
    :
    -   Prophylactic antibiotics: Bactrim DS daily, often used 6
        months-1year after transplant
        -   -   If unable to tolerate Bactrim, consider cephalosporins
                or nitrofurantoin (if GFR>60 and typically for 1 month
                only) in effort to prevent fluoroquinolone resistance
    -   Basic infection prevention measures: hydration, frequent
        voiding, wiping front to back, voiding after sexual intercourse
    -   Removal of indwelling devices/catheters as able
    -   Consider post-coital antibiotics for women with recurrent UTI
        after sexual intercourse
    -   Estrogen cream for peri/postmenopausal women (restores
        epithelial barrier)
    -   Inconclusive data on cranberry juice

Presentation

-   Simple cystitis:
    dysuria, frequency/urgency, hematuria, suprapubic tenderness. No
    systemic symptoms and no indwelling catheters/stents/tubes.
-   Acute pyelonephritis/complicated UTI:
    above symptoms + fever/chills, malaise, nausea or allograft pain,
    leukocytosis
    -   Also includes urinary tract anomalies and/or indwelling
        catheters/stents/tubes
-   The transplanted kidney is denervated, and pts may be not have upper
    urinary symptoms

Evaluation

-   UA
    with culture (midstream collection or “clean catch”)
-   Examine
    the native kidneys (CVA tenderness) AND the allograft (RLQ or LLQ)
-   Renal
    U/S (of both allograft and native kidneys) if: early post-op (1
    month), recurrent (2+ episodes in year), history of nephrolithiasis
    or if sepsis/bacteremia
-   Blood cultures if signs/symptoms of complicated UTI (systemic
    symptoms) OR if urine culture are consistent w/ hematogenous spread
    to the bladder (such as Staph aureus)
-   Consider
    testing for C. urealyticum if UA positive but culture negative

Management

-   Always
    get UA with culture (midstream collection)
-   Remove
    or replace indwelling catheters
-   Review
    prior culture susceptibilities (if available)
-   Empiric
    antibiotic regimens:
    -   -   Simple cystitis
            : Fluoroquinolones (ciprofloxacin 250 BID or Levaquin 500 mg
            daily), Augmentin (500 mg BID), 3 <sup>rd</sup> gen
            cephalosporin (cefpodoxime 100 mg BID or cefixime 400 mg
            daily) or nitrofurantoin 100 mg BID (if GFR>30)
        -   Complicated UTI/Pyelonephritis
            (cover *Pseudomonas,* gram negatives and *Enterococcus* ):
            Rocephin 2g daily (preferred), Cefepime 2g q8hrs or Zosyn
            3.75g q6hrs, can also use meropenem 1g q8h (need ID
            approval)
            -   Note, Dr. Langone does not like Rocephin, but prefers:
                Cefepime if LE+, nitrite +, Zosyn if LE+ and nitrite –
                (covers enterococcus), or LVQ
        -   For stable pts with mild complicated UTI, can consider
            giving more narrow empiric antibiotics: Augmentin 875 mg BID
            or ciprofloxacin 500 mg q12h
        -   MDR UTI: Consult transplant ID
            -   Options: meropenem-vaborbactam, ceftolozone-tazobactam,
                ceftazidime-avibactam
        -   If pts w/PCKD, include lipophilic antibiotic (such as
            ciprofloxacin) to penetrate cysts
-   Duration
    :
    -   -   Simple cystitis: \<6 months post-transplant: 10-14 d; >6
            months post-transplant: 5-7 d
        -   Complicated UTI: 14-21 d
        -   Transition to oral if susceptible to Levaquin or Cipro
            (bioavailable in urinary tract)

Additional Information

-   Asymptomatic
    bacteriuria: no consensus; recommend getting 2 <sup>nd</sup> culture
    to confirm prior to treating
    -   -   Often treated if \<1-3 months since transplant. > 3 months
            post-transplant likely do not require UA screenings and/or
            treatment for asymptomatic bacteriuria
-   Positive
    Blood Cultures Related to UTI
    -   -   Repeat blood cultures are NOT typically indicated for
            uncomplicated gram negative bacteremia or for bacteremia
            from a localized source (such as pyelonephritis)
        -   Consider repeating cultures when: concern for endovascular
            involvement, MDR gram negative bacilli, persistence of
            fever/leukocytosis >72 hours after initiation of appropriate
            antibiotic
            regimen, new sepsis, concern for abscess or no source
            control
