# AIDP
 
Acute Inflammatory Demyelinating Polyneuropathy (AIDP)

Background

-   Rapid onset polyneuropathy that manifests most often with ascending
    weakness and numbness that can involve the respiratory and facial
    musculature also
-   Usually
    preceded by infectious illness a few weeks prior, some flu
    vaccination associations

Presentation

-   Acute
    , progressive extremity weakness, weak or absent reflexes, and
    potentially subjective sensatory changes
-   Often, infectious symptoms precede AIDP symptoms by a few weeks
    -   There are a TON of variants of AIDP, with some having cranial
        nerve weakness early, proximal weakness, sensory ataxia,
        primarily sensory loss, or rapid muscle weakness; **do not use**
        lack of classic ascending weakness to dismiss the idea of AIDP
    -   Sensory loss is common in an ascending pattern too

Evaluation

-   LP
    – albuminocytologic dissociation = high protein & normal cell count
    -   One exception is HIV, which can cause AIDP but also have a high
        cell count and high protein count
-   EMG/NCS
    – shows a demyelinating pattern (temporal dispersion and decreased
    conduction velocities). This can be normal in the first few days and
    may need to be repeated 2 weeks after if the diagnosis is not clear
-   Differential diagnosis **:** spinal cord lesions can mimic GBS
    including with areflexia, LEMS, sometimes MG, acute HIV or HCV,
    viral myelitis (entero/West Nile)

Management

-   ABCs! NIF at baseline then Q4-6 hours
    -   NIF \< -30 with good effort generally warrants ICU monitoring
-   IVIG
    or PLEX (PLEX requires central line)
-   Can get worse if you give them steroids
