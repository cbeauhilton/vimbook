# Seizures
 
Seizure without Status Epilepticus

Background

-   Risk factors: birth trauma, prematurity, TBI with loss of
    awareness > 1 hour, strokes/tumors/abscesses, history of
    meningitis/encephalitis
-   Key for seizures: stereotyped event with sudden onset/offset
    -   Generally, if full body systems are involved (e.g., jerking or
        tonic activity, then there will also be loss of awareness)

Evaluation

-   A clear description or recording of seizure semiology is helpful
-   Provoked seizures can develop with medications, hypo/hyperglycemia,
    significant electrolyte abnormalities (e.g. hyponatremia), and CNS
    infections
-   EEG is necessary for spell capture
-   MRI brain with and without contrast

Management

-   Common AEDs with indications and typical side effects (SE):
    -   Levetiracetam/Keppra (PO/IV): general or focal sz. SE: sedation
        and agitation, can worsen underlying mood disorders
    -   Valproic acid/Depakote (PO/IV): general or focal sz. SE:
        sedation, hirsutism, PCOS like symptoms, P450 inhibitor, nausea,
        liver injury, hyperammonemia
    -   Phenytoin/Dilantin (PO/fosphenytoin is IV): focal or general sz.
        SE: sedation, unsteadiness, gingival hyperplasia
    -   Lacosamide/Vimpat (PO/IV): focal or general. SE: heart block
        (don’t use if pt has pre-existing blocks), dizziness, ataxia
    -   Topiramate/Topamax (PO) –general or focal sz. SE: kidney stones,
        metabolic acidosis, paresthesia’s, weight loss, cognitive
        slowing
    -   Carbamazepine/Tegretol (PO) –focal and general sz. SE: hypoNa,
        in Han Chinese HLA testing is recommended due to risk of SJS,
        rare reports of bone marrow suppression
    -   Oxcarbazepine/Trileptal (PO) –focal and general sz. SE similar
        to carbamazepine, hypoNa
    -   Lamotrigine/Lamictal (PO) –general or focal sz. Benefit of mood
        stabilization. SE: SJS/TEN, nausea. One of the least sedating
        AEDs
    -   Zonisamide/Zonegran (PO) –general and focal. SE: somnolence,
        ataxia, nausea, confusion

Non-Epileptic Spells (aka PNES, psychogenic non-epileptic spells)

-   Can be very difficult to distinguish from epileptic seizures
-   Retained awareness with bilateral extremities “seizing” is very
    unusual for epileptic sz’s
-   Other red flags: opisthotonus (arching the back), talking during a
    spell, excessively long spells (if historically patient has
    “seizures lasting for hours or days” at home), forced eye closure,
    coachability during a spell or reacting to external stimuli, very
    heavy breathing during a spell with lots of rigorous movement,
    immediately returning to normal after a spell
-   Things that are hard to be non-epileptic: seizures arising out of
    sleep, highly stereotyped, incontinence, severe injuries (e.g.
    burns)
-   If high concern for PNES, try to avoid excessive BZD use. This
    requires good clinical judgement as you wouldn't want to withhold
    Ativan and discover that the pt was having true atypical seizures.
    The compromise would be: do not repeatedly administer BZDs when
    there is suspicion for PNES as well as no evidence of response to
    prior BZD administration.
-   Notably, **syncopal convulsions** are very common, with posturing
    and tonic-clonic movements happening for a few moments after syncope
    -   Should not last for more than 10-15 seconds
    -   These are just related to syncope and do not typically require
        seizure medications
    -   Workup:
        -   -   Two-hour EEG and MRI (with and without contrast)
            -   Infectious workup, BMP, CBC, blood glucose,
                toxicology/drug screen
            -   If there is concern for convulsive syncope, (carefully)
                check orthostatic vitals
