# MS
 
Multiple Sclerosis

Background

-   Progressive inflammatory disorder primarily manifesting with
    demyelination of the central white matter
-   Optic neuritis and transverse myelitis (spinal cord lesion) are
    common presentations
-   Generally develop over a few days; very uncommon to happen suddenly
    ( e.g., patients will complain about a dark spot appearing in their
    vision that expands over several days)

Evaluation

-   MRI w/ and w/o contrast can identify plaques and determine if they
    are more acute
    -   “Active” MS plaque will enhance, and continues to for weeks
        (even after treatment)
-   Modified MacDonald Criteria:
    ≥
    3 characteristic demyelinating lesions (>1 cm, periventricular,
    infratentorial (brainstem/cerebellum/cord) or juxtacortical in
    location) with evidence of separation in time (active and chronic)
-   LP can be done to look for oligoclonal bands, IgG index, cell count
    and protein

Management

-   Treat flares with steroids: speeds up recovery but does not improve
    the degree of recovery
    -   Would confirm with Neurology (as primary or consulting team)
        preferred dose, which is often methylpred 1g to start
    -   Current guidelines are for optic neuritis to be treated with IV
        steroids, but recent data challenges this
-   If a patient with known MS has worsening symptoms that are not new,
    then recrudescence is the likely cause -> infectious/toxic/metabolic
    workup and imaging is needed
-   Several long-term medications, with common side effects listed
    below:
    -   Interferon (SQ injections) – flu-like symptoms, injection site
        reactions
    -   Glatiramer acetate (SQ) – injection site reactions
    -   Fingolimod (PO) – macular edema, liver injury, increased risk of
        skin cancer
    -   Teriflunomide (PO) – liver injury, hair loss, immunosuppression,
        teratogenic
    -   Dimethyl fumarate (PO) – GI side effects, lymphocytopenia, liver
        injury
    -   Natalizumab (IV) – PML concern, immunosuppression
    -   Ocrelizumab (IV) – contraindicated in active HBV infection,
        cannot give live vaccines
    -   Alemtuzumab (IV) – autoimmune disease, rash, headache

Neuromyelitis Optica and Spectrum Disorder:

-   Demyelinating disease due to Ab against aquaporin-4 (on
    oligodendrocytes)
-   Classically causes optic neuritis and longitudinally extensive
    transverse myelitis
-   Can be more aggressive than MS and needs steroids but in severe or
    refractory cases PLEX
-   NMO antibodies and MS workup as above is done
