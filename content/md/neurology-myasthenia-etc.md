# Myasthenia etc
 
Myasthenia Gravis (MG) and Lambert-Eaton Myasthenic Syndrome (LEMS)

Background

-   Both are disorders at the neuromuscular junction
-   MG
    affects
    the post-synaptic cleft at the acetylcholine receptor
-   LEMS
    affects
    the pre-synaptic cleft at the calcium channels

Presentation

-   Double
    vision, ptosis, dysarthria, dysphagia
-   Dyspnea looks different than in other conditions: air hunger,
    usually also with dysphagia
-   Initially
    , the patient may not look sick or distressed, but may have a short
    inspiratory time or difficulty speaking in complete sentences due to
    shallow breathing
-   Most pts have a known history of myasthenia, but up to 20% present
    initially with crisis

Evaluation

-   Exam: Look closely for ptosis, nasal speech, weak neck
    flexion/extension (same nerve roots as diaphragm), interrupted
    speech to take extra breaths
-   These patients do not exhibit “huffing and puffing” work of
    breathing in the way that pts with COPD/asthma exacerbations or post
    exercise may look
    -   Patients with NMJ disease can go from talking to intubated
        within several hours!
    -   LEMS: less ocular weakness, but do have extremity weakness and
        absent reflexes. Many cases are paraneoplastic (classically
        small cell carcinoma of the lung)
    -   Pulmonary compromise is very rare in LEMS
-   EMG
    /NCS - MG will show decremental response to rapid stim, and single
    fiber EMG (gold standard) can be done. SFEMG cannot be done in ICU
    settings due to electrical artifact
-   Myasthenia
    antibody panels can be ordered (send prior to IVIG/PLEX being given)
-   Chest CT -> looking for thymic hyperplasia

Management

-   NIF (negative inspiratory force, a measurement of diaphragmatic
    strength; normal is \< -60) at baseline on arrival and then Q4-6H
    -   If getting below -30 consider elective intubation, certainly ICU
    -   Can see NIF under flowsheets on Epic
    -   Some pts’ effort can be impaired resulting in poor NIF values
-   IVIG or PLEX -> both have similar supportive evidence; IVIG is
    usually easier to do
    -   PLEX
        has the risks you would expect with dialysis (e.g. fluid shifts)
        and coagulopathy
    -   IVIG
        -> have to check IgA levels (deficiency is a rare cause of
        anaphylaxis) and can increase risk of DVT, has risk of aseptic
        meningitis and provides and significant fluid load so not ideal
        for pts with CHF
-   Steroids are also usually up-titrated SLOWLY (by 10-20 mg prednisone
    daily, not much more of an increase) and pyridostigmine is continued
-   Rapid increases in steroids can worsen patients with MG
-   Too much pyridostigmine can make patients worse, so for those doing
    poorly on >90 mg per dose, consider lowering the dose
-   Treat underlying causes of exacerbations: usually infections or
    other toxic/metabolic insults
-   Remove/avoid exacerbating medications: fluoroquinolones,
    aminoglycosides, beta blockers, and magnesium
-   LEMS
    : 3,4-diaminopyridine and can respond to IVIG or pyridostigmine
