| Tension type (most common) | Generally bilateral, pressure/tightness, mild/moderate pain, no significant photophobia/phonophobia, nausea                                                                                                                        | Acetaminophen, TCA’s, SNRI’s, anticonvulsants                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| Migraine                   | Unilateral/pulsating, moderate/severe pain, lasting 4-72hr, associated nausea, photophobia or phonophobia; ± aura, worse with physical activity, often improves with sleep                                                         | Acute: triptans Preventive: TCAs, propranolol, topiramate, VPA                                                                                                                                                                           |
| Cluster                    | Severe, often extreme unilateral orbital/supra-orbital/temporal pain, often with lacrimation, rhinorrhea, sweating/swelling of face, visual change                                                                                 | Acute: 100% FiO2 at 12L/min for at least 15 mins, triptans Preventive: verapamil; some data for nightly melatonin to regulate circadian rhythms                                                                                          |
| Medication Overuse         | HA at least ½ the days of the month, w/medication intake at least ½ the days of the month; often presents as worsening HA despite increased intake of medication. Often seen with meds that include caffeine (excedrine, fioricet) | Acute: 100% FiO2 at 12L/min for at least 15 mins, triptans Preventive: Verapamil \*STOP offending medication, typically via taper. HA will worsen before it gets better (can be alleviated with naproxen taper and/or steroid dose pack) |

Medication Overview:

-   Abortive
    -   Sumatriptan or rizatriptan are generally first choices. Cannot
        be used more than 10 days/month. Avoid in pts with
        hypertension/CAD
-   Preventative – generally start low and increase dose every few weeks
    -   Amitriptyline: indicated for both migraine and tension-type.
        Helps with sleep and comorbid depression. Most common side
        effects (SE) = dry mouth, sedation
    -   Topiramate: has the best evidence among migraine meds. Can
        theoretically help with weight loss. Most common SE = sodas
        taste bad, sedation
    -   Propranolol: useful for relative lack of interactions. Mild
        cardiac/blood pressure effects compared to other beta-blockers.
        Most common SE = drowsiness
    -   Magnesium oxide: reduces headache frequency with almost no SE.
        Start 400mg daily, can go up to 800mg BID. Patients can increase
        dose until they get diarrhea.
    -   Riboflavin (vitamin B2): mild effect but effectively has no side
        effects. 400mg daily.
    -   Gabapentin: can be useful if HAs have stabbing/electric quality.
        Main SE = sedation
    -   Venlafaxine: useful for migraines with significant vestibular
        symptoms (dizziness)
        -   
        -   Major
            SE = insomnia, hypertension/tachycardia
    -   Verapamil: can be used for migraine and cluster headaches. Can
        use ER formulation
    -   Botox: can be administered every 3 months. Can be very
        effective, but pts generally will have had to fail multiple
        medications for insurance to approve
    -   CGRP receptor modulators (mostly injections) such as Rimegepant
        are newer options
