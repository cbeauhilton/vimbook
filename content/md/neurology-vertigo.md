Vertigo

Background

-   Sensation of the room spinning or moving, or themselves spinning or
    moving
-   Distinguishing between vertigo and orthostasis/presyncope via
    history is important
    -   Ask about triggers, exacerbating factors, duration, if it has
        happened before
    -   Ask about vascular risk factors, as stroke is an uncommon cause
        of isolated vertigo
    -   Presentation based on Cause:
        -   BPPV – short duration, very positional, classically
            nystagmus is horizontal and torsional with the posterior
            canal being most commonly involved
        -   Vestibular Neuronitis/labyrinthitis – typically follows URI
            or ear infections; often self-limited, but can be
            severe/prolonged, in which case it is treated with steroids
        -   Menière’s Disease – tinnitus and low range frequency hearing
            loss, generally progressive and treated with diuretics,
            meclizine and sometimes surgeries or intratympanic
            injections
        -   Endolymphatic Leak – usually following trauma or concussive
            blasts, requires ENT eval and management. Classically a loud
            sound will cause vertigo and nystagmus
        -   Vertigo may also be caused by migraines, possibly without
            associated headache

Evaluation/Management

-   Careful exam of vertigo will be more helpful than random scans, but
    pt has to be symptomatic for exam to mean anything:
    -   HINTS Battery
        – head impulse test, nystagmus pattern, test of skew
        -   Central pattern – no corrective saccade, multidirectional
            nystagmus, skew present
        -   Peripheral pattern –
            corrective saccade, unidirectional nystagmus, no skew
            present
    -   Dix-Hallpike Test
    -   Cerebellar testing: FNF, HKS, mirroring, gait
-   Central patterns will need head imaging with vessel imaging (looking
    for vertebral dissection or basilar clots)
    -   Often, central vertigo is due to centrally acting medications
-   Peripheral causes are varied and often require eval by ENT as an
    outpatient
-   Treatment with anticholinergics like meclizine or scopolamine is
    often helpful
-   Vestibular therapy with OT is also very beneficial
-   Example of HINTS test
