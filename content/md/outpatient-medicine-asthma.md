# Asthma
 
Asthma – Trent Goodin, Stacy Blank

Background

-   Ask about triggers: cold, exercise, URIs, allergens, inhaled
    irritants
-   Ask about family history or personal history of atopy, eczema,
    allergic rhinitis
-   Exam: wheezing, prolonged expiratory phase; nasal polyps, rhinitis,
    eczema
-   Evidence of reversible airflow obstruction (i.e. improvement of
    obstruction post-bronchodilator) or airway hyper-reactivity
    (methacholine challenge)

Evaluation

-   Spirometry (PFT’s) with reversible obstruction
    -   FEV1/FVC \<0.7;
        #
        FEV1 12% and 200 mL after bronchodilator
-   “All That Wheezes Is Not Asthma” rule out alternative diagnoses:
    -   Panic attacks, upper airway obstruction, foreign body, vocal
        cord dysfunction, CHF (cardiac asthma), COPD, ILD

Classify Severity and Assess for Symptom Control with the RULE OF 2s:

-   Does the patient have symptoms or require rescue inhaler
    ≥
    2 times per week?
-   Does the patient endorse nighttime symptoms
    ≥
    2 times per month?
-   Does the patient have to refill rescue inhaler
    ≥
    2 times per year?
-   Does the patient ever have to limit activity due to asthma symptoms?

Initial Assessment of Severity:

-   Intermittent: No to all of the above and FEV1> 80% predicted. Start
    at step 1
-   Persistent: Yes to any question above. Start at Step 2
-   Mild
    :  Less than daily symptoms, less than weekly nighttime symptoms,
    minor limitation to activities
    -   FEV
        \>80% predicted
-   Moderate:  Daily symptoms, weekly nighttime symptoms, some
    limitation to activities
    -   FEV
        60-80% predicted
-   Severe: More severe symptoms than above, FEV1 \<60% predicted
    -   Consider
        referral to pulmonary

Management

-   Aim to use the lowest possible step to maintain symptom control.
    Also consider stepping down therapy if pt has been well-controlled
    for >3 months
-   Prior to escalating therapy, consider:
    -   Adherence to therapy (including inhaler technique), uncontrolled
        comorbidities (allergies, GERD, OSA, etc), and alternative
        diagnoses
    -   Ensure patients receive MDI and spacer teaching for full effect.
-   Updated Guidelines: prn ICS - LABA > prn SABA Step 1 (mild
    intermittent) and Step 2 (mild persistent)
    -   Reduces exacerbations, easier to schedule does in future if
        needed
    -   SYGMA Trial showed rescue/prn Budesonide-formoterol (ICS - LABA)
        non-inferior to daily ICS-LABA + prn SABA in preventing
        exacerbations

Additional Information

-   Follow-up
    -   Repeat
        PFTs q3-6 mosafter beginning therapy and q1-2 yrs thereafter
    -   Regular follow up at least q6 mos for all patients with asthma
-   VA specific guidance:
    -   Mometasone
        is the formulary ICS and Symbicort (budesonide-formoterol) is
        the formulary ICS/LABA
    -   Ordering
        PFTs: Refer to Pulm section on PFTs for VUMC and VA specifics
