Background

-   ICD 10 Codes: International Classification of Disease Codes, 10th
    Revision. Used to categorize all diseases and symptoms.
-   CPT Codes: Current Procedural Terminology Codes: Numeric codes
    assigned to every task and service a physician may provide to a
    patient including medical, surgical, and diagnostic services. They
    are used by insurers to determine the amount of reimbursement that a
    practitioner will receive.
-   E&M Codes: Evaluation and Management Codes. These are a category of
    CPT codes and are the most frequently used. There are different
    levels of E&M codes, which are determined by the complexity of a
    patient visit and documentation requirements. Example: 99204 (new
    patient, level 4) or 99213 (established patient, level 3).
-   Preventive Service Codes: A category of CPT codes used for annual
    wellness exams. Example: 99395 (established patient, age 18-40).

Problem Oriented Visits

-   Return and new patients for which you are mainly addressing one or
    more acute or chronic problems should be filed under an E&M code.
-   Documentation for these visits only need to include what you as a
    physician think is medically appropriate.
-   The correct E&M code for the visit will depend on three
    categories: (1) medical complexity, (2) level of risk with
    testing/treatment, and (3) the amount/complexity of data reviewed.
    To meet criteria for a given code, the visit must meet the criteria
    in at least 2 of the 3 aforementioned categories.

Annual Wellness Visits (Not Medicare)

-   Return and new patients you are seeing for a preventive annual exam
    should be filed under a preventive service code.
-   Documentation for this visit MUST include a comprehensive update of
    PMH, Surgical Hx, Meds/Allergies, Social Hx and Family Hx, a
    14-point ROS (i.e. your note must say something along the lines of
    “14 systems were reviewed and pertinent positives are noted in the
    HPI), and anticipatory guidance/risk factor reduction.
-   The correct preventive service code will depend on patient age and
    the ICD-10 code should be Z00.00
-   This visit can only be coded for once every 365 days (although some
    insurances may allow you to code an annual each calendar year, every
    365 days is a safe bet)
-   CPT Codes:
    -   Code 99395 (established) or 99385 (new): Preventive Annual Exam,
        age 18-40.
    -   Code 99396 (established) or 99386 (new):Preventive Annual Exam,
        age 40-65.
    -   Code 99397 (established) or 99387 (new): Preventive Annual Exam,
        age 65+ (NOT Medicare patients).

Annual Wellness Visits (Medicare)

-   Return and new Medicare patients (not Medicare managed plans like
    Cigna Medicare, etc) you are seeing for a preventive annual exam
    should be filed under a Medicare specific preventive service code.
