Lipids – Jonathan Davis

Background

-   1º Prevention: pts  at increased risk who have not yet had a
    vascular event
-   2º Prevention: pts  with pre-existing occlusive vascular disease or
    ASCVD (e.g., stroke, TIA, CAD + angina, ACS, coronary or arterial
    revascularization, PAD)
-   Screening:
    USPSTF 2016 Guidelines: adults 40-75yrs
    -   ACC/AHA 2018 Guideline: adults 21-75 q 4-6yrs; \<21yrs  if
        strong fam hx

Evaluation

-   Fasting vs Non-Fasting Lipid Panel.
    -   Triglycerides
        are most impacted by non-fasting testing which can artificially
        lower LDL-C depending on how the laboratory measures/calculates
        LDL. Consider fasting lipid panels when triglyceride levels are
        high
-   Consider 2º causes of HLD in initial workup: hypothyroidism, DM,
    EtOH use, smoking, liver disease, nephrotic syndrome, CKD, meds
    (e.g., thiazide, glucocorticoids)

Management

-   Lifestyle changes:
    -   Heart Healthy Diet:
        ↓
        trans/saturated fats, choose skim milk, low-fat dairy products
    -   Emphasizes fruits, vegetables, whole grains, poultry, fish, nuts
        and olive oil, while limiting
        red
        and processed meats, sodium and sugar-sweetened foods and
        beverages
    -   Promote a healthy weight, regular exercise, smoking cessation,
        limit EtOH

Statin Therapy

-   Initiate as outlined in the following algorithms (Note: check
    AST/ALT prior to initiation)

Statin Side effects

:

-   Myalgias: bilateral involving large muscle groups, onset within
    weeks of initiation of therapy and should resolve within weeks of
    cessation
-   Spectrum of statin associated muscle symptoms (SAMS) include
    myalgias, myopathy, rhabdomyolysis, autoimmune myopathy, etc.
    -   Consider
        evaluation with CK, BMP, TSH, and vitamin D
    -   ACC has a “Statin Intolerance Calculator” to help assess
        etiology of symptoms

Additional Information

-   If patient is not tolerating a statin, consider:
    -   Holding statin until symptoms resolve and trialing lower dose or
        alternative statin (Pravastatin and Fluvastatin may have lower
        risks of myopathy)
    -   Every other day dosing with atorvastatin and rosuvastatin
        (longer half-lives)
-   If repeated
    failed attempts, consider **alternative agents** : Ezetimibe
    10mg daily

Hypertriglyceridemia

:

-   Moderate: TG 175-499 mg/dL; Severe: TG > 500 mg/dL
    -   Focus
        on addressing lifestyle factors and stopping medication that
        increase TG’s  (HCTZ, some BB’s, estrogens, some ART,
        antipsychotics)
    -   Consider
        medical therapy when TG> 500mg/dL to $ risk of pancreatitis
        with:
        -   Omega
            -3-fatty acids: 4gms daily or Vascepa 4gm daily
        -   Fibrates
            : Fenofibrate 120mg daily (avoid in CKD), Gemfibrozil 600mg
            daily (increased risk of myopathy with concomitant statin)
-   PCSK9
    inhibitor
    requires referral to Lipid Clinic
