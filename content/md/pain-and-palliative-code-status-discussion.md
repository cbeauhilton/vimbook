# Code Status Discussion
 
Code Status Discussion – Katie Sunthankar

-   The approach to obtaining someone’s code status should be thoughtful
    and pertinent to their current admission or recent change in
    clinical status. First ask yourself “Why would this pt code?  Is
    resuscitation a reversible treatment in this pt’s case?  What are
    the chances that this pt will survive to discharge following CPR? Is
    the anticipated outcome in line with the pt’s goals? After you have
    made your assessment, then make a recommendation based on both the
    efficacy of resuscitation and the patient’s goals. (90-year-old male
    with an MI may survive CPR but may wish to die a natural death. A
    35-year-old with advanced cancer may be willing to endure CPR even
    if the chance of success is miniscule) Sometimes it is difficult to
    ascertain, and you can ask your attending his/her thoughts. For
    example, a 40 y/o pt admitted with cellulitis should probably be
    full code however an 83 y/o pt with class IV NYHA heart failure,
    CKD4 and significant frailty should probably be DNR/DNI. It is
    important that you are incorporating 1) the pt’s goals with 2) your
    understanding about the efficacy of CPR for that pt and help them
    come to an educated decision.

-   Below are examples of phrases that can be used in framing code
    status. It is important to do this step wise. **NEVER say “Do you
    want us to do everything?”** This is a question very few people are
    okay with saying no to. It is more helpful to give examples of when
    these situations would arise.

Admitting a patient:

-   Introduction
    : Normalize the conversation by stating that “these are questions we
    routinely ask everyone when they come into the hospital.  This is a
    way for us to understand your wishes in the event you are unable to
    make your own decisions.” Otherwise, they can be caught off guard
    and not be able to meaningfully participate in the conversation.
-   Surrogate
    : “If you were unable to make decisions for yourself for whatever
    reason, who would you trust to make your decisions?  The person you
    pick does not have to be family but should be able to speak to your
    wishes and make the same choices you would make for yourself. \[In a
    cirrhotic\] For example, if you were to get confusion from your
    liver disease?”
-   Intubation
    : Always do this first so you can avoid the sticky DNI but not DNR
    situation. Again, normalize the question.  “Everyone has different
    opinions on what types of medical care they would want if they
    became sicker. One of the things we like to talk about are
    ventilators or breathing machines. Some tell us to try a breathing
    machine for a trial, but they would not want to be kept alive on a
    ventilator.” Now make a recommendation.  “In your case I think if
    you were to need a ventilator, based on your health I think it would
    \[work, not work,\]” Pause and allow them to ask questions. Also
    remember that if they say DNI, then they *must* be DNR because
    intubation occurs with ACLS (this is not allowed at VUMC but is at
    the VA… I don’t recommend getting in this situation).
-   CPR
    : Prime this question with “The next question I have to ask you can
    be hard to think about, but it is important that we know what you
    would want. In the event you had a cardiac arrest, that is, when
    your heart stops beating, which would mean you died? This is
    different from a heart attack. \[pause\]. We know based on the
    evidence that CPR is not always successful.  It really depends on
    the situation.  In your case, I think CPR would be (make a
    recommendation here). Knowing this, would you want us to attempt CPR
    or try to resuscitate you?”

What if you don’t agree with your patient’s decision…

-   At the end of the day, it is their decision (attendings may change
    the code status out of medical futility in Tennessee).
-   If you think the pt didn’t understand, or was overwhelmed, or the
    clinical situation has changed, you may want to go back and revisit
    the conversation, perhaps with another family or friend present. 
    Some pts have seen CPR on a loved one and seen it be successful and
    others have only seen it on TV. These experiences greatly influence
    their decision.
-   Consider framing the discussion differently and offer your
    recommendation: “While you are in the hospital, we will support you
    with interventions and medications that we think are helpful based
    on what you have told us important to you. However, we are worried
    that some of the interventions you are asking for may do more harm
    than good. Many people think that CPR works like it does on TV. 
    Unfortunately, we know that the vast majority of patients who need
    CPR in the hospital do not survive like they do on TV.  In your
    case, we do not think it would bring you back to your current
    state.  I worry that this is not something that will be helpful to
    you.”
-   Sometimes it can be more of a discussion after a patient says “Yes I
    would want CPR” you can respond “I understand and respect your
    choice… maybe we can talk more about this later, in particular if
    your health changes.”
-   Worried they may not understand CPR? Note that it is important to
    share at the beginning of the conversation otherwise the patient may
    feel like you are trying to coerce them into a decision. “Can I
    share some numbers about how often CPR can help?” Sometimes using
    fingers to show these numbers helps. “If you take 10 people in this
    hospital and all of their hearts stop beating, which would mean they
    have died, and we get to them as fast as possible, only 3 of them
    would have their hearts restarted and only 1 of them would ever
    leave the hospital.”
-   Another phrase that is helpful (and when the discussion occurs with
    surrogates leads to higher rates of changing code status than saying
    DNR): “allow for a natural death”. For example, “I worry that given
    how sick your \[loved one\] is, that the additional interventions of
    CPR if she were to die, would prevent her from having a natural
    death”
