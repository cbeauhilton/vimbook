# The Death Pronouncement
 
The Death Pronouncement – Michael J. Neuss

This scenario arises in a variety of contexts, including the units,
wards, and cross-cover. You might know the patient and family well, but
particularly when cross covering, that may not be the case

This approach to the death pronouncement is based in part on the AAFP’s
“Death Pronouncement: Survival Tips for Residents” (Am Fam Physician.
1998 Jul 1;58(1):284-285.)

Before Entering:

-   Familiarize yourself with the most important points of the patient’s
    hospitalization; it is ok to take a moment to read about the
    patient’s course and inquire about the day’s events with the
    patient’s nurse or other staff.
-   Inquire as to which family is present prior to entering, including
    whether the POA is currently at bedside.
-   Be aware of the circumstances of the patient’s death, particularly
    whether death was expected or sudden.
-   In general, it is best to enter accompanied, ideally with the
    patient’s nurse. It is rare for the chaplain to be present but that
    might also be a consideration.
-   Inquire with the nurse if Tennessee Donor Services (TDS) has been
    notified; often, when death is anticipated, the nurse will already
    have done this, although that is not always the case. Remember that
    it is not your position/role to approach the family regarding organ
    donation, but TDS should have been notified and there should be a
    case number, which in Epic you will have to document.

In The Room:

-   Especially when cross-covering, make sure to introduce yourself to
    family, and allow them time to introduce themselves to you.
-   Less is more when it comes to what you say: it can be good to be
    empathetic (consider only short statements such as “I am sorry for
    your loss”) but focus mainly on the task at hand, allowing time for
    families to be present with their loved one.
-   Explain that you have been called to examine the patient to confirm
    that they have passed. Allow a brief time for questions; it is rare
    (but not impossible) that someone may wish to excuse themselves for
    the pronouncement, and although I do not commonly inquire if family
    would like to be present, this is a consideration.
-   Note the location of a working clock when you enter; your watch is
    ok too but do make sure to avoid looking at your smartphone to check
    the time of death.

The Exam And Pronouncement:

-   Identify the patient by wrist band.
-   Note general appearance.
-   Confirm that the patient does not respond to stimuli; one discreet
    way to confirm a lack of response to tactile stimuli is to hold the
    hand, and apply pressure to a nailbed, appearing to hold the hand
    while looking at/visually inspecting the face or other part of the
    body. You should avoid any obvious painful stimuli, out of respect
    for the deceased as well as out of deference to family who may be
    present.
-   Confirm the absence of spontaneous respirations.
-   Confirm the absence of heart sounds.
-   Examine the pupils and note the absence of pupillary light reflex.
-   Note the time at which your examination is completed. This is the
    time of death. It is ok (although not required; this is merely a
    consideration) to speak the time of death quietly and respectfully,
    for the family’s reference as well as staff’s.
-   Make sure to ask for an autopsy. This is often overlooked, and as
    awkward as it might feel to ask for this, it is a requirement and
    asking later (if overlooked) feels more awkward.
-   Often phrased as something that must always be offered to all
    families, but not often requested by families of patients.
-   Make sure you have notified the attending of record

Death Process at the VA

Nurse will notify physician at time of death for pronouncement.

THEN:

Physician will arrive to pronounce patient’s death within 1 hour of
notification by nursing staff.

THEN:

Physician to examine patient and pronounce death—offering family
chaplain support and informing family of death. Chaplain is notified by
calling the Administrative officer on duty (AOD).  Physician informs
nursing staff of time of death so that they can call TN donor services.

THEN:

Physicians at time of pronouncement will ask family regarding the
request for autopsy. VA pays for the autopsy and this is provided as a
benefit to the family if desired.  Family can decline this benefit. 
Physician should document if the family agreed to or declined the
autopsy benefit.

THEN:

Death note is documented in CPRS by physician pronouncing death using
the template provided to house staff.  Death note documents the time of
death, cause of death, family notified, and autopsy request with family
response to the autopsy request.

THEN:

Physician pronouncing death will complete additional death report
paperwork which includes the cause of death.  This death paperwork is
provided to the physician by the charge nurse or clerk and is available
at the nursing station.  Once completed, this paperwork is returned to
the nursing staff.

THEN:

Nursing staff notifies TN donor services.  Nursing staff contacts the VA
decedent affairs clerk during business hours.  Nursing staff may contact
the AOD instead of the decedent affairs clerk if the death occurs after
hours or on weekends.  The decedent affairs clerk or AOD provides
information to family regarding veteran death and funeral benefits.

THEN:

The body of the patient is removed from the room within 4 hours of death
and taken to the morgue to await transfer to the families’ choice of
funeral homes

Death

Process

in EPIC

-   The key thing is to ensure that all components are completed in the
    “Discharge as Deceased” tab under the Transfer-Discharge screen
-   EACH AND EVERY
    component of this tab must be completed before Decedent Affairs will
    accept the body

Required steps:

-   Cardiopulmonary Death Charting
    
    Select “New Reading” and complete.
-   Cardiopulmonary Death
    
    Select “+Create Note”
-   Medical Examiner Criteria
    
    Select “+New Reading”; note that in general deaths that we expect
    and have an established medical cause generally do not need to go to
    the Medical Examiner (ME). If there is any concern for harm, foul
    play, drug overdose, etc, have a low threshold to contact the ME.
    The Vanderbilt Operator can assist with connecting you to the ME;
    alternatively, you can call 615-743-1800 during business hours (M-F
    8am – 4:30pm) or the after-hours pager at 800-216-0107.
-   Autopsy Criteria
    
    Select “+New Reading”
-   Preliminary Cause of Death and Date/Time of Death
    
    Select the ribbon at the top of this and enter a cause of death.
    Rather than list “Cardiopulmonary arrest” do try to be specific (eg
    Pulmonary Embolism, Myocardial Infarction, Metastatic Colon Cancer,
    etc) if you know the underlying cause of death.
-   Deceased’s Info – Report of Death. This will ask many questions.
    -   If you need to leave this and return later after collecting
        information, you can access your partially complete entries by
        clicking on the date/time text that appears under the ribbon.
        This is not intuitive because the numbers listing the date/time
        do not at all appear as though they act like a hyperlink (but
        they do).
    -   Be specific; TDS will want you to have listed the name of the
        family you notified, the TDS Case Number (which the RN should
        have or can assist in collecting), and your attending
        physician’s name (to sign the death certificate; give their
        pager number in this subsection).
-   Report of Death Note
    
    Select “+New Reading” and complete.
-   Complete Synopsis + Hospital Course and then at the very bottom
    under Summary of Death select “+Create Note.”
-   Once all of this paperwork is finished, be sure to touch base with
    the patient’s nurse, as s/he is often the contact for Decedent
    Affairs and can assist in making sure the body is moved
    expeditiously
