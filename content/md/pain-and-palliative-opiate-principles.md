Conversion:

-   Transition between opiates is done using oral morphine equivalents
    (OMEs), in which each drugs’ potency is compared to oral morphine
    (see table).  For example, 1 mg of IV morphine is equal to 3 mg of
    oral morphine.
-   When transitioning, doses are traditionally reduced by 1/4 to 1/3
    due to cross tolerance. (Oxycodone 5 is a pretty standard dose,
    which converts to 7.5 mg of oral morphine, 2.5 mg of iv morphine,
    and 0.375 of iv hydromorphone.)

Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCAs) aka Pain Pumps:

-   Pumps
    can be programmed to deliver a continuous rate and/or a bolus dose.
    The basal rate is a continuous infusion dosed per hour that cannot
    be adjusted by the patient. The demand dose is a patient-directed
    bolus that is given at a prescribed frequency (whenever the pt
    presses the button).  Both the actual dose and frequency of bolus
    dose can be adjusted. The general rule of thumb is to calculate the
    total OME delivered through the demand when a pt is in steady state
    and convert 75% of this dose into the total continuous rate or basal
    infusion. Alternatively, if a pt is chronically on a long-acting
    opioid, this total amount of OME (sustained release) can be
    converted into a basal rate of opioid.  The demand dose is 25% of
    the hourly rate given every 15 minutes.
-   Remember that the basal rate will not get to steady state for at
    least 8 hrs; therefore, when you admit pts or are transitioning pts
    to a PCA, always initiate the PCA pump with a bolus (or loading)
    dose.

How to Order PCA at VUMC

:

-   Select Analgesic:
    -   Hydromorphone
        (most common): Order “Hydromorphone (DILAUDID) PCA”
    -   Fentanyl
        (if on at home; not a good inpatient PCA): Order “Fentanyl PCA”
    -   Morphine
        : Order “Morphine PCA”
-   Select “\[Analgesic\] PCA syringe” and adjust the following to pt
    needs:
    -   PCA
        Dose (“Demand”): amount the pt gets when s/he presses the button
    -   Lockout
        Interval: time between which “demand” doses will not be
        administered if s/he presses the button (i.e., the PCA “locks
        out”)

1.  1.  Optional: many palliative care providers may not include this to
        allow patients more liberty to control their pain, depending on
        the situation

-   -   Continuous
        Dose (“Basal”): amount the pt gets per hr in continuous infusion
    -   Max
        Dose: maximum amount of analgesic (Basal + Demand) pt can get in
        24 hours

-   Select “IV Carrier Fluid Options”> Choose Fluid option

-   Select all “PCA Nursing Orders”

How to Order PCA at VA:

-   Under Orders, select “Pain/Sedation Infusions”
-   Under “PCAs,” select Analgesic of choice (Hydromorphone or Morphine)
-   Adjust the following:
    -   Load
        : amount the pt will receive on initial set up of PCA
    -   Basal
        : amount the pt gets per hour in continuous infusion
    -   Demand
        : amount the pt gets when s/he presses the button

Interrogating PCA (to determine amount of analgesia pt received):

-   Look at IV pump display. If it does not display info about PCA, hit
    “Channel Select” on PCA
-   Select “Options” in bottom left of IV pump
-   Select “Patient History” on the left of the screen. This shows the
    administration history for a certain time period (e.g., 24h, 12h,
    4h, etc)
-   Hit “Zoom” on bottom of screen to change time period to 24 hours.
    Should show:
    -   Total
        Drug: total amount of drug received in last 24 hours
    -   Total
        Demands: amount of times the pt has pushed the button for demand
        dose
    -   Delivered
        : amount of times the pt actually received a demand dose
    -   The
        difference between “Total Demands” and “Delivered” is the number
        of times the patient pushed the button without receiving a dose
        (due to pushing the button during the lockout interval).
-   If you have questions about interrogating the PCA, ask the nurses!
    They are a great resource!

Opioid Side effects

-   Constipation: dose-dependent and will not develop tolerance. If pt
    has opioids, they need robust bowel regimen (miralax, senna) with
    goal of BM
    ≥
    every 3 days. For opioid-specific constipation can do SQ Relistor
    (methylnaltrexone) but this is expensive and can only be given in
    the PCU or oncology floors at VUMC. For patients with chronic
    opioid-induced constipation as an outpatient can trial oral agents
    like Movantik (naloxgeol). Can also consider PO naloxone but it does
    have small amount of bioavailability so watch for systemic reversal.
-   Nausea: occurs with opiate naïve pts. Consider starting an
    anti-emetic concurrently.  Most pts will develop tachyphylaxis with
    this over a day, so the antiemetic can be discontinued.
-   Urinary retention: Consider role of opioids in pts with new-onset or
    worsening urinary retention. Try to de-escalate opioid dosing if
    possible.
-   Overdose: In pts with apneic emergency, IV 0.4 mg Naloxone; however,
    low threshold for multiple doses until response. With respiratory
    depression in chronic opioid pts start with IV 0.02 mg q2-3min to
    avoid profound withdrawal. This helps prevent acute pain crisis. In
    pts taking long-acting opioids, may need to redose q30min and
    consider IV infusion for them. For pts prescribed opioids as
    outpatient, need naloxone 4 mg intransasal.
-   Pruritis: due to histamine release from mast cells; can be treated
    with antihistamines. The opioid can also be rotated. Some but not
    all pts will develop tachyphylaxis to this symptom.
-   Toxicity: hyperalgesia and neuroexcitatory effects (AMS, myoclonic
    jerking, seizures). Risk   factors for neuroexcitatory effects are
    rapid titration, dehydration or renal failure.
