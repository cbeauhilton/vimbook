# Back Pain
 
Acute Back Pain – Christian Roehmer

Background

-   Lifetime risk \~ 70% of Americans
-   RF: age, obesity, smoking, socioeconomic status, and psychological
    factors
-   \>90% of back pain is nonspecific and musculoskeletal in nature
-   Can’t Miss: Spinal cord compression, cauda equina, cancer, spinal
    abscess, or osteomyelitis
-   Extra-axial causes: Pancreatitis, nephrolithiasis, pyelonephritis,
    AAA, zoster

Presentation

-   Lumbar strain: diffuse pain in lumbar muscles, may radiate
-   Degenerative disk or facet process: localized lumbar pain, similar
    to lumbar strain
-   Inflammatory arthritis: morning stiffness, improves with movement,
    systemic symptoms
-   Osteoarthritis: pain with use, improves with rest
-   Herniated disk: radiating pain to legs, often below the knees
-   Compression fracture: older patients, trauma, spine tenderness on
    exam
-   Spinal stenosis: pain improves with flexion, shopping cart sign
-   Spondylolysis: pain with extension
-   Spondylolisthesis: pain with activity, improves with rest, can be
    seen with imaging
-   Scoliosis: abnormal spine curvature, seen on physical exam
    inspection

Evaluation

-   Physical Exam:
    -   Inspection: Should include posture, Adam’s Forward Bend Test
        (screens for scoliosis), and limb length discrepancy
        
        kyphosis, lordosis, or scoliosis
    -   Palpation/Percussion: Sensitive for identifying spinal
        infection, metastases, or compression fractures
        -   Spinous processes, lumbar “step-offs,” paravertebral muscles
            and SI joint
    -   Range of Motion: Pain with extension and relieved by flexion
        suggests spinal stenosis
    -   Neurologic Examination:
        -   L2: hip flexion; L3: knee extension; L4: dorsiflexion; L5:
            great toe flexion
        -   S1: plantarflexion
    -   Waddell’s Signs:  Raise suspicion of **non-organic pain**
        -   Superficial tenderness, pain that improves with
            distraction (attention diverted)
        -   Pain with sham maneuvers (simulation)
        -   Overreaction (disproportionate psychomotor responses)
        -   Non-physiologic neurologic deficits
-   ESR/CRP: Can be used if concern for infection or malignancy

-   Imaging:
    -   AP and lateral plain films; Bilateral oblique films (evaluate
        for spondylolysis)
        -   Indications: Pts at risk of fracture, Red flag symptoms,
            Evaluate for ankylosing spondylitis, No improvement in pain
            after conservative therapy after 6-12 weeks
    -   Non-contrasted MRI (Preferred)
        -   Indications: Suspicion for spinal cord/cauda equina
            compression, Severe neurological deficits, concern for
            infection, Unexplained inflammatory marker
            ↑

Management

-   First line: conservative therapy for 4 to 6 weeks, **avoid** bedrest
    -   Physical therapy
    -   NSAIDs: Ibuprofen 600 – 800 mg q 4-6 hr, Diclofenac (topical) 2
        g TID-QID (7 days)
    -   Heat, massage <u>+</u> acupuncture
-   Adjuncts for pain:
    -   Robaxin: 750 mg – 1.5 g 3-4 times daily for 2-3 days, then
        <u>\<</u> 4.5 g/day over 3-4 doses
    -   Flexeril: 5 mg tid, or 5 once qhs with Tylenol or NSAID
-   Pts with neuro deficits or spinal cord compression warrant urgent
    surgical evaluation
-   Refer to Spine PT program at VUMC
-   Refractory or Severe Pain: Referral to orthopedics or PM&R spine
    specialist
