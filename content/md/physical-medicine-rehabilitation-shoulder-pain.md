# Shoulder Pain
 
Shoulder Pain – Joseph Nowatzke

Background

-   Bones:
    Clavicle, Scapula (Acromion and Coracoid process) and Proximal
    Humerus
-   Rotator Cuff: Supraspinatus, Infraspinatus, Teres minor,
    subscapularis
-   Neurovascular: anterior and posterior circumflex humeral arteries,
    branching off axillary artery; Innervated by axillary,
    suprascapular, subscapular nerve off
    brachial plexus
-   Labrum is a cup-shaped rim of cartilage lining and reinforces the
    shoulder joint by surrounding the glenoid fossa, allowing extra
    support to the head of the humerus

Presentation

-   Brachial Plexus Palsies
-   Vascular Pathology (e.g. thoracic outlet syndrome, thrombus,
    atherosclerosis, vasculitis)
    -   Typical symptoms are tightness, heaviness, cramping, or weakness
        in arm
-   Rotator Cuff Injuries:
    -   Impingement Syndrome: supraspinatus is most susceptible
    -   Tendinopathy: develops after repetitive motions; pain worsens
        with active movement
    -   Tendon Tear: develop as a progression of tendinopathy; develops
        weakness
-   Labral Tear & SLAP (superior labral tear from anterior to
    posterior): develop in repetitive overhead motions (swimming,
    baseball, tennis); often described as a “catching” sensation
-   Adhesive capsulitis: “frozen shoulder” stiffened glenohumeral joint,
    loss of both active and passive RoM. Increased frequency in
    diabetics
-   AC (acromioclavicular) joint pain: joint often affected by OA, RA
    and common cause for anterior shoulder pain shoulder separations
    and osteoarthritis
-   Glenohumeral OA: degeneration of articular cartilage and subchondral
    bone with narrowing of the glenohumeral joint. Presents in older
    adults with progressively worsening anterior shoulder pain and
    stiffness in both passive and active ROM
-   Biceps Tendinopathy: localized anterior shoulder pain, worsened with
    overhead lifting; when rupture develops, will often have a “lump”
    and acute worsening of symptoms
-   Posterior shoulder pain often related to cervical radiculopathy

Evaluation

-   Physical Exam:
    -   Inspection: Symmetry, erythema, ecchymosis, swelling, deformity,
        muscle atrophy (deltoid, infraspinatus), scapular winging
    -   Palpation: warmth, landmarks, tenderness: SC joint, clavicle, AC
        joint, acromion, spine of scapula, bicipital groove, biceps
        tendon, greater tuberosity of humerus, common myofascial trigger
        points (trapezius, levator scapulae, rhomboids, supraspinatus)
    -   Passive ROM: performed by the examiner without patient
        assistance
        -   Helps to distinguish motion limitations caused by a
            structural constraint (adhesive capsulitis) vs. motion
            limitations caused by pain
    -   Active ROM: performed by the pt on their own. Loss of active
        motion usually indicates weakness due to either muscular (tears)
        or nerve injury
    -   C-spine: evaluate the C-spine as the origin of pain that may be
        referred to the shoulder
    -   Provocation tests: see Below
-   Imaging:
    -   Not as useful as a thorough physical exam, especially if
        non-traumatic pain
    -   XR: AP (Internal Rotation, External Rotation), Lateral, Scapular
        and axillary views
    -   CT: often reserved for traumatic fracture and artificial joint
        assessment
    -   MRI w/out contrast: used to evaluate soft tissues, tendons,
        muscle and bursae
    -   Ultrasound: becoming more useful for initial evaluation of
        rotator cuff

Management

-   Fractures: require assessment by orthopedics for reduction and
    surgical intervention
-   Soft Tissue Injuries, Arthritis
-   Conservative management: referral to physical therapy for muscle
    strengthening, flexibility, and postural improvement.
-   Consider short course of NSAIDs, 7-10 days (meloxicam, diclofenac)
    for pain relief
-   Injections can often be diagnostic and therapeutic – refer to ortho
-   Sports Medicine referral for surgical evaluation if pt fails
    conservative therapy
