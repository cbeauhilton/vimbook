Indications

-   Extracorporeal therapies: HD, CRRT, Plasma (PLEX) or RBC exchange
    transfusion

    Hemodynamic monitoring (CVP, ScvO2), and cardiac parameters (via

Pre-procedural considerations

-   All patients need to have telemetry & pulse oximetry monitoring
-   With every pt, consider LENGTH, LOCATION, LUMENS, and LINE TYPE!

| Internal Jugular Vein | Minimal risk of PTX; improve target with positioning and use of US; easily compressible if bleeding occurs | Risk of carotid puncture; difficult in obese pt; vein collapsibility with hypovolemia             |
| Subclavian            | More comfortable for pts; landmark driven approach; lowest risk of infection                               | Increased risk of PTX, harder to control bleeding with pressure; technically more difficult       |
| Femoral               | Easiest to access; no risk of PTX; can be placed during CPR and intubation                                 | High risk of infection and difficult to sterilize; patient unable to move; higher thrombotic risk |

| Triple Lumen (7Fr)                   | Most common line placed; used for central access for vasopressors, caustic infusions (chemo) | Consider lumens needs; triple lumen is most versatile but can warrant dual lumen |
| MAC or Cordis\*                      | ‘Short and fat’ allowing rapid transfusion; MAC has two ports                                | MAC is placed with dilator still in introducer                                   |
| Dialysis Catheter (Trialysis, 12 Fr) | Dialysis line with two 12 Ga. Lumens for dialysis with a third 17 Ga. lumen for added access | Two serial dilations                                                             |

\*Can place triple lumen in MAC for additional ports; lose ability to
rapidly transfuse

Procedural considerations

-   Numb pt right after draping, then set up everything to allow time
    for lidocaine to work
-   Set supplies up in exactly the order of use to ensure all are
    present and functioning
-   Cap side ports with blue claves (not included in Trialysis kit)
    prior to flushing
-   For IJ access, place patient in slight Trendelenburg position to
    engorge vein
-   While advancing needle, ensure constant negative pressure with
    aspiration of plunger and visualization of needle tip with US
-   Always ensure guidewire is secured while it is inside a vein
-   Always ensure target for venous cannulation is visualized and
    guidewire is placed correctly prior to dilation: 1) Compression of
    target vessel 2) Non-pulsatile dark blood return (unless on
    100%FiO2, may be brighter red) 3) US visualization or needle and
    wire 4) can use pressure tubing and angiocath to confirm CVP or
    obtain venous O2 sat

Post-procedural considerations

-   Every IJ or subclavian central line needs a confirmation CXR to
    confirm no PTX
-   Ideal placement of distal tip: in SVC just outside the right atrium.
    Approximately near/superior to carina and right tracheobronchial
    angle
-   Troubleshooting Complications:
    -   Arterial Access or puncture: immediately remove needle and place
        non-occlusive pressure for 15 mins to prevent hematoma
        formation; if uncontrolled bleeding or artery was dilated, STAT
        vascular surgery consult
    -   Bleeding: place direct pressure; subclavian access precludes
        ability to compress and confers highest bleeding risk; if
        uncontrolled, STAT vascular surgery consult
    -   Pulmonary Complications: if free air aspirated into syringe,
        consider PTX vs poor seal of syringe & needle. Close attention
        to pulmonary complication & STAT CXR to assess PTX. If rapid
        deterioration, needle decompression and chest tube placement
        required
    -   Venous Air Embolism: can occur if air introduced to system
        during placement, flushing, or if left open to the atmosphere.
        Effects are variable, but if suspected, place pt in left lateral
        decubitus position to trap air in right apex and place pt on
        100% O2 to speed resorption
    -   Arrhythmia: rationale for telemetry monitoring as guidewire
        often leads to atrial or ventricular arrhythmias; Immediately
        withdraw wire to lesser depth. If arrythmia persists, abort
        procedure and treat patient and determine cause
