Absolute Contraindications

-   Increased intracranial pressure from space occupying lesions
-   Infection over puncture side or epidural abscess
-   Trauma to mass or lumbar vertebrae

Relative Contraindications

-   ↑
    intracranial pressure, thrombocytopenia, bleeding diatheses,
    anticoagulation

Pre-procedure considerations:

-   Consider sending to fluoro-guided if: Attempts without imaging are
    unsuccessful, morbidly obese pts with no palpable anatomy, severe
    scoliosis, prior spine surgery, borderline low Plts and multiple
    sticks might be needed, or pt requires heavy sedation
-   IR guidelines require Plavix to be off 5 days; ASA alone is OK
-   Full dose LMWH must be off 24h, ppx LMWH off 12h, ppx heparin off
    8h, hep gtt off 4-8hrs with repeat lab demonstrating normalized PT
-   P2Y12 inhibitors should be held for 7 days to avoid bleeding risks
-   Labs: cell count w/diff, BF culture, glucose, protein; if infectious
    or neurological labs are needed, consider consult first Try to
    freeze sample for future labs (order in epic).
-   Ensure lateral decubitus position for open pressure with glass
    pressure manometer

Procedural considerations

-   US Probe: Linear (can use curvilinear in obese pts) in transverse
    axis to establish midline & in sagittal axis to identify spinous
    processes
-   Volume removal for studies: Basic only 2mL per tube in 1-4. Many
    studies ordered: 3mL per tube (\*consider calling lab to confirm).
    Cytology desired: call lab to confirm amount needed (rule of thumb
    2/2/6/2mL); Tube 4 is sent for micro to reduce contamination.
    Therapeutic high volume: 30mL max
-   Anesthetic use: Lidocaine 1-2% (likely need more than what is
    provided in kit; consider empiric anesthetization of 2 spaces +/-
    Pain-Ease spray.
-   Increased number of attempts = increased success rates
-   Higher rate of success if stylet is removed before entering
    subarachnoid space to better observe flow of CSF once in the
    subarachnoid space. Stylet should be replaced prior to LP needle
    removal
-   Aspiration of CSF = increase risk of bleeding. Don
    ’
    t do that!

Post-procedural considerations <span id="_Hlk64109621"></span>

-   Post-LP headache
    (\~10%): encourage pt to lay flat to reduce the intensity of
    symptoms (but does not prevent it); if prolonged, consider blood
    patch (c/s Anesthesia)
-   Neuro changes OR bleeding complications: STAT non-contrast MRI
    lumbar spine for epidural hematoma, q1 neuro-checks x4hrs then q2
    for 24-48hrs & consult NSGY
-   Sample cannot be tubed; someone must walk fluid to the lab
-   Resuming anticoagulation: 1h UFH, 4h LMWH, 4-6h
    rivaroxaban/apixaban, 6h dabigatran/fondaparinux. Longer periods
    should be considered after traumatic tap, and post-procedure
    monitoring of neurological function is recommended for all pts
