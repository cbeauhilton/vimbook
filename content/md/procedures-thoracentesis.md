# Thoracentesis
 
Video Guide:

Indications

-   New pleural effusion (that has no obvious explanation)
-   Any respiratory symptoms that would positively respond to large
    volume thoracentesis

Pre-procedural considerations

-   If loculations present on US, high risk, or any question about
    indication, refer to Pulm
-   Labs (order before so nurse can print labels): cell count w/diff; BF
    culture, BF & serum LDH, BF & serum total protein; BF & serum Hct if
    bloody; cytology if c/f malignancy

Procedural considerations

-   US Probe: Cardiac (or Linear) to identify safe pocket between lung
    and diaphragm
-   Kit:  6Fr Safe-T-Centesis kit
-   Upright position is typically preferred; lateral to mid-scap/mid-ax.
    If patient unable to sit upright, refer to procedure team vs
    pulmonology
-   Effusion size: if unable to tap above 9 <sup>th</sup> rib, too
    small; CXR with costophrenic angle blunting should correlate to
    \~250-500mL
-   Keep patient in same position throughout
-   Superior to rib to avoid nerve bundles and vessels
-   Stop if pt has any new/increased chest discomfort, aggressive
    unremitting cough, frank purulence or air on aspiration,
    lightheadedness, hypotension, or vagal response.
-   Stop fluid removal after 1.5 L of chronic pleural effusion to reduce
    re-expansion pulmonary edema. May also reduce PTX. Check U-shaped
    manometry every 400-500 cc to assess intrathoracic pressure; avoid
    pressures more negative than -15-20 cm H2O

Post-procedural considerations

-   If needing cytology, send at least 60
    –
    100cc
-   Bleeding complication: STAT page Thoracic Surgery
-   PTX: if pt stable & asymptomatic, supplemental O2 and repeat CXR in
    4hrs; if unstable/symptomatic STAT page to Thoracic Surgery
-   Re-expansion pulmonary edema: persistent cough, frothy sputum.
    Diffuse GGO on side of thoracentesis. Supportive management (oxygen,
    monitor); most resolve in 24-48 hrs. If respiratory distress
    progresses, may need mechanical ventilation.
-   Documentation:  Effusion US characteristics (anechoic, laying
    debris, septations) Reason for ending procedure (stopped early due
    to chest discomfort/cough, complication vs tapped dry); presence of
    lung sliding/whether more than scant residual effusion remains
    post-procedure by ultrasound
-   A routine chest radiograph after thoracentesis is no longer
    indicated for most asymptomatic, non-ventilated patients. Check lung
    slide with US in 2D and M-mode
