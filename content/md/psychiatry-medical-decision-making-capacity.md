# Medical Decision-Making Capacity
 
Medical Decision-Making Capacity – Chelsea Sprick, Neil Phillips,
Jonathan Smith

-   Capacity can be assessed by any physician regarding a pt’s ability
    to make a ***specific*** medical decision at a ***specific*** point
    in time
-   Competency:
    “global decision-making capacity,” a legal determination made by a
    judge
-   If the patient does not have medical decision-making capacity:
    -   Identify and remedy cause of impairment if possible (if decision
        is non-urgent)
    -   Identify surrogate decision maker

Assessing medical decision-making capacity

-   Choice: patient must clearly indicate a consistent choice
    -   “Have you decided whether to follow the recommendation for the
        treatment?”
    -   “Can you tell me what your decision is?”
-   Understand
    : pt must grasp the fundamental meaning of the information
    communicated by the medical team
    -   “Please tell me in your own words what you were told about:
        -   The problem with (1) your health now and (2) the recommended
            treatment
        -   The risks/benefits of (3) treatment, (4) alternative
            treatments and (5) no treatment”
-   Appreciate: the medical condition and likely consequences of
    treatment options
    -   “What do you believe is wrong with your health now?”
    -   “What is treatment likely to do for you?”
    -   “Do you believe you need treatment?”
    -   “What do you believe will happen if you’re not treated”
    -   “Why do you think this treatment was recommended?”
-   Reason: patient must rationally manipulate relevant information
    -   “What makes the chosen option better than the alternative?”
    -   “How did you decide to accept or reject the recommended
        treatment?”
