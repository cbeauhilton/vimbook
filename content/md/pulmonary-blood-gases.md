Did you order an ABG or VBG?

-   If you need to assess oxygenation (PaO2), then must order an ABG. An
    ABG is also the most accurate way to assess PaCO2 and pH
-   If you want to assess hypoventilation, a VBG is informative and
    usually similar, but it may be inaccurate in some cases such as
    shock or severe hypercapnia
-   The pH on a VBG usually correlates with an ABG (i.e. venous pH is
    \~0.05 lower than arterial pH), but this is less accurate in shock
    or severe acid-base disturbance
-   ABGs are obtained by respiratory both at VUMC and the VA. VBGs can
    be ordered the same as any other lab. Alternatively the nurses can
    obtain a VBG (+lactate) with the iSTAT in the ICU at either VUMC or
    VA, which will return considerably faster
    -   To order iSTAT at VUMC, order "Respiratory Lab Panel" and choose
        selections
    -   To order VBG at VA, order POC CG4+ (standard), POC CG8+ (loaded
        VBG), or simply enter a free text order "please obtain VBG"

Assessing Oxygenation:

On an ABG, can use the arterial PaO2 (measurement of O2 dissolved in
plasma) to assess oxygenation and calculate the A-a gradient.

A-a gradient = PAO2 (alveolar O2) – PaO2 (arterial O2)

-   P <sub>A</sub> O <sub>2</sub> = FiO <sub>2</sub> (P
    <sub>barom</sub> - P <sub>H2O</sub> ) - PaCO <sub>2</sub> /R
    -   FiO2 = 0.21 on room air otherwise obtain from ventilator
    -   P <sub>barom</sub> = 760, P <sub>H2O =</sub> 47
    -   R (respiratory quotient) = 0.8
    -   PaCO <sub>2</sub> = arterial CO2 measured on ABG
    -   Normal A-a gradient = (Age +10)/4
-   Common Reasons for an Increased A-a Gradient:
    -   V/Q Mismatch: PE, atelectasis, PNA, pulmonary edema,
        pneumothorax, ILD, COPD
    -   Diffusion limitation: interstitial lung disease
    -   R
        à
        L Shunt Physiology:
        -   Cardiac: PFO, VSD, ASD, AVMs
        -   Pulmonary: blood, pus, water(edema), cells, protein in the
            Alveoli

Assessing Acid/Base Status and Ventilation:

-   Look at the pH (normal = 7.35 – 7.45)
    -   pH \< 7.35 = acidosis
    -   pH > 7.45 = alkalosis
        -   Look at the pCO2 (normal = 35-45 mmHg *)*

| Primary Disorder      | pH      | pCO2 |
|-----------------------|---------|------|
| Respiratory Acidosis  | \< 7.35 | \>45 |
| Respiratory Alkalosis | \> 7.45 | \<35 |
| Metabolic Acidosis    | \< 7.35 | \<45 |
| Metabolic Alkalosis   | \> 7.45 | \>35 |

-   Is the primary disorder acute vs. chronic?
-   Is the primary disorder appropriately compensated?
-   If not appropriately compensated, what additional process is
    present?  

Primary Respiratory Acidosis:

-   Assess patient’s history: Is this acute or chronic?
    -   Acute respiratory acidosis and hypercarbia will often present
        with somnolence or AMS
    -   Similarly, if a PCO2 is 80, and the patient is talking to you,
        it is most likely chronic
-   Common Acute Causes: Decreased respiratory drive (opiates,
    intoxication) or respiratory muscle weakness (i.e. myasthenia gravis
    exacerbation)
-   Common Chronic Causes: COPD, sleep apnea
-   Appropriate metabolic compensation?
    -   If acute, every 10 mmHg increase in pCO2 above normal (40)
        should raise HCO3 by 1
        -   Expected HCO3 = 24 + ((pCO2 -40)/10))
            If chronic, every 10 mm Hg
            ↑
            in pCO2 above normal (40) should raise HCO3 by 3.5
        -   Expected HCO3 = 24 + 3.5 ((pCO2-40/10)).
-   If HCO3 higher than expected
    à
    additional metabolic alkalosis
-   If HCO3 lower than expected
    à
    additional metabolic acidosis  

Primary Respiratory Alkalosis

-   Assess patient’s history: Is this acute or chronic?
    -   Common Acute Causes: Mechanical ventilation, anxiety/panic
        attack, pain, PE
    -   Common Chronic Causes: Pregnancy, CNS disorder, hormones
        (thyroid, progesterone)
-   Appropriate metabolic compensation?
    -   If acute, every 10 mmHg change in pCO2 should decrease the HCO3
        by 2
        -   Expected HCO3 = 24 – 2\*((40-pCO2/10)
    -   If chronic, every 10 mmHg change in pCO2 should decrease the
        HCO3 by 4
        -   Expected HCO3 = 24 – 4\*((40-pC02)/10)
-   If HCO3 higher than expected
    à
    additional metabolic alkalosis
-   If HCO3 lower than expected
    à
    additional metabolic acidosis

Primary Metabolic Alkalosis

-   Appropriate Respiratory Compensation?
    -   Expected pCO2 = 0.7\*(HCO3) + 20 (+/-5)
-   Etiologies: Majority of causes are associated with high aldosterone
    (either appropriate or inappropriate)
    -   Chloride Responsive
        = appropriate hyperaldosteronism, can usually be fixed with NaCl
        administration/ volume resuscitation
        -   Etiologies: Volume contraction i.e vomiting, over-diuresis
            which stimulates kidneys to reabsorb Na (and Cl absorbed
            with Na)
        -   Urine Cl \<20
-   Chloride Unresponsive
    = inappropriate hyperaldosteronism, cannot fix with NaCl
    administration/ volume resuscitation as already likely volume
    overloaded
    -   -   Etiologies: Steroids, Cushing’s, Conn’s, RAS, CHF, cirrhosis
        -   Urine Cl >20.
