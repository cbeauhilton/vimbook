| COPD Exacerbation – Taylor Coston |

Background

-   Diffuse wheezing, distant breath sounds, barrel-shaped chest,
    tachypnea, tachycardia, smoking >20 pack years
-   Features of severe respiratory insufficiency: accessory muscle use;
    fragmented speech; inability to lie supine; profound diaphoresis;
    agitation; asynchrony between chest and abdominal motion with
    respiration; failure to improve with initial emergency treatment
-   Features of impending respiratory arrest: Inability to maintain
    respiratory effort, cyanosis, hemodynamic instability, and depressed
    mental status
-   Remember: Patients with COPD can have other causes of respiratory
    distress including acute coronary syndrome, decompensated heart
    failure, PE, PNA, PTX, sepsis, acidosis

Evaluation

-   Initial Assessment: ABCs
    -   Airway/Breathing
        -   Ensure patient is protecting airway. If obtunded or in
            severe respiratory distress (see above) call anesthesia
            early for consideration of endotracheal intubation. *(If in
            the* MICU during the day, just call the MICU fellow)
            -   Noninvasive ventilation (NIV), particularly BiPAP:
                Appropriate for most patients with severe COPD
                exacerbation unless immediate intubation is needed or
                other contraindication (vomiting, too obtunded to take
                off mask if necessary, facial trauma). Necessitates MICU
                admission
            -   Remember: BiPAP is ordered as IPAP and EPAP. I.e. if the
                pt is on 12/5 the mask will deliver a pressure of 12
                when breathing in and 5 when breathing out.
            -   12/5 is a good start, in comments write “auto-titrate”
                and the RT will have some leeway to change settings
        -   Immediate pharmacotherapy, in tandem with diagnostics and
            airway mgmt
    -   Circulation
        -   For hemodynamic instability, HR \< 50, call anesthesia for
            immediate rapid sequence intubation (RSI). Pt’s can be
            hypotensive for a host of reasons including pneumothorax,
            sepsis, circulatory collapse from hypoxia and bradycardia,
            etc.
-   Subsequent Workup:
    -   Continuous pulse oximetry, ABG/VBG, EKG, CXR, CBC, BMP,
        troponin, BNP (if considering HF dx), Sputum cx, consider blood
        cx if concern for sepsis, rapid flu.
    -   Lung Ultrasound to differentiate COPD from pulmonary edema when
        a pt presents with wheezing and respiratory failure (pulmonary
        edema will have Kerley B lines)
    -   During evaluation, consider triggers for COPD exacerbation:
        viral infection (70%), PNA, PE. **Have a high index of suspicion
        for PE in these pts** .

Management

-   Manage airway
    as above - many pts will need BiPAP if severe respiratory distress
    or hypercapnia are present
-   Bronchodilators
    -   Order “Respiratory Care Therapy Management Protocol” at VUMC
    -   When ordered, an RT evaluates the pt and based on physical exam
        will give a duoneb
    -   The RT will then continue to assess the pt based on severity of
        the exacerbation
    -   If ordering bronchodilators individually (this is discouraged)
        order:
        -   Albuterol 2.5 mg diluted to 3 mL via nebulizer or 4 to 8
            inhalations from MDI every 4 hours while awake (RT), or more
            frequently if needed
        -   Ipratropium 500 mcg via nebulizer, or 4-8 inhalations from
            MDI q 4 hrs while awake
        -   Can additionally order "duoneb" at VUMC
        -   There is no respiratory order protocol at the VA, order
            individually as above. RT is available to assess if needed
-   Steroids
    -   For severe exacerbation give methylprednisolone 125 mg IV BID
        (or 60mg IV q6h)
    -   For moderate to mild COPD exacerbations give prednisone 40mg PO
        daily for 5 days (including the initial IV dose if pt received
        one in the ER)
-   Antibiotics
    -   Benefit less clear in mild to moderate exacerbations
    -   Azithromycin 500mg x 1 then 250mg daily for 4 days or
        doxycycline 200 mg BID if concern for QT prolongation. Can also
        consider Levaquin 750mg PO daily for 5 days, however this is
        often too broad for a standard COPD exacerbation.
    -   Refer to “Pneumonia” if treating a separate PNA in addition to
        COPD
-   Discharge Planning:
    -   Teaching on medication compliance and appropriate use. Ensure pt
        has a spacer
    -   Pulmonary Rehab
    -   Vaccinations (see outpatient management COPD in handbook)
    -   Controller medications/inhalers (see outpatient management COPD
        in handbook)
    -   Exacerbation Action plans: No consensus as to what the
        components should be, but instead a patient-specific plan can be
        made should the pt’s symptoms recur
