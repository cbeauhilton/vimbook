Summary of Medicare Part B Guidelines for Home Oxygen:

-   Conditions for Which Oxygen Therapy May Be Covered:
    -   Severe lung disease including COPD and ILD (regardless of known
        etiology), CF, bronchiectasis, widespread pulmonary neoplasms
    -   Hypoxia related symptoms or findings expected to improve with
        O2: pulmonary hypertension, recurring CHF secondary to chronic
        cor pulmonale, erythrocytosis, impaired cognition, nocturnal
        restlessness, morning headache
-   Qualifying Tests and Requirements:
    -   Testing must be performed with a pt in chronic stable condition
        (i.e. outpatient clinic) or within two days of discharge from an
        inpatient hospital stay (after treatment of acute exacerbating
        conditions have been trialed, ie. infection, bronchospasm)
    -   Medicare requires that test results must be documented in a pt’s
        medical record and made available to the oxygen provider
-   Patient can be tested under either of these conditions:
    -   At rest: SpO2 ≤ 88% (or PaO2 \<55)
    -   If no hypoxia at rest, perform with exercise (“Ambulatory Sats”)
        -   Ask RN or RT to perform and document in Epic—they have a
            template:
            -   SpO2 at rest
            -   SpO2 on room air with ambulation (must desat ≤ 88%)
            -   Amount of O2 (in L) required to maintain SpO2 > 89%
-   Special Considerations:
    -   Medicare requires an additional walk on 4L/min showing
        desaturation if the patient needs a flow rate of  5L/min or
        higher
    -   Because of the risk of desaturation with exertion and the
        intrinsic error in the pulse ox (around 3%), patients with
        resting saturations of ≤ 92% should be walked to assess O2 needs
    -   Be aware that if the patient has Raynaud’s or poor circulation,
        a finger pulse oximeter reading may be inaccurate and read lower
        than the patient’s actual saturations.  A head saturation
        monitor should be used in these circumstances
-   Try to perform any of these diagnostic tests 1-2 days prior to
    anticipated discharge. Be sure to touch base with your CM about the
    need for home oxygen, as they will help arrange
-   VA Specific Guidance: Will need to document ambulatory saturations
    in notes as above. Call the Oxygen Clinic (number listed in all team
    rooms) and talk with your case manager

Summary of Medicare Part C Guidelines for Home Respiratory Assist
Devices i.e CPAP/BiPAP:

-   Restrictive Thoracic Disorders: Covered if the following criteria
    are met:
    -   There is documentation in the MR of a neuromuscular disease or a
        severe thoracic cage abnormality and one of the following:
        -   An arterial blood gas PaCO2 ≥ 45mmHg, performed while awake
            and on home O2 requirement, OR
        -   Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤ 88%, for ≥ 5
            minutes of nocturnal recording time (minimum recording time
            of 2 hours), performed while on home O2 requirement, OR
        -   For a neuromuscular disease (only), either:
            -   Maximal inspiratory pressure \< 60cm H2O or
            -   Forced vital capacity \< 50% predicted and
        -   COPD may not contribute significantly to the patient’s
            limitations
-   Severe COPD: Covered if the following criteria are met:
    -   An arterial blood gas PaCO2 ≥ 52mmHg, performed while awake and
        on patient’s prescribed home O2
-   Sleep oximetry demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤ 88% for ≥ 5 minutes
    of nocturnal recording time (minimum recording time of 2 hours),
    performed while breathing oxygen at 2LPM or patient’s prescribed
    FIO2 (whichever is higher), AND
    -   Prior to initiating therapy, sleep apnea and treatment with a
        continuous positive airway pressure (CPAP) device has been
        considered and ruled out (formal sleep testing not required)
-   Hypoventilation Syndrome: covered if criteria 1, 2, AND either 3 or
    4 are met:
    -   An initial arterial blood gas PaCO2 ≥45 mm Hg, performed while
        awake and on home O2 requirement, AND
    -   Spirometry shows an FEV1/FVC ≥ 70% AND
    -   An arterial blood gas PaCO2, performed during sleep or
        immediately upon awakening that demonstrates worsening PaCO2 of
        ≥ 7mm Hg compared to the original result in criterion 1 OR
    -   A facility-based PSG or HST demonstrates oxygen saturation ≤ 88%
        for ≥ 5 minutes of nocturnal recording time (minimum recording
        time of 2 hours) that is not caused by obstructive upper airway
        events, i.e., AHI \<5
-   OSA:
    -   An initial screening for OSA in the hospital is nocturnal pulse
        oximetry. The distinct “saw-tooth” pattern representing
        intermittent hypoxia is suggestive of OSA, and a formal NPSG or
        home sleep test is recommended to evaluate for OSA.  This is
        done on an outpatient basis only once acute issues have fully
        resolved
    -   Home CPAP/BiPAP covered IF:
        -   The diagnosis of central sleep apnea or complex sleep apnea
            and
        -   Significant improvement of the sleep-associated
            hypoventilation occurs with the use of the device
