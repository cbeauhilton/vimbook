# Consults for Radiology Procedures
 
-   Radiology Procedures are performed by three separate consult
    services depending on the clinical indication or procedure requested
-   Knowing the correct service will save you time when placing consults
    to reach the right service on first attempt
-   Contacting the ***<u>pager</u>*** for the appropriate service is the
    best way to speak directly with one of the physicians covering these
    services (MD’s are most often performing procedures or seeing
    patients, not located at the service desks)
-   These pagers are covered 24/7, often by the same person for up to a
    week at a time ( ***not a nightfloat*** ), so kindly **reserve
    overnight pages for true urgent / emergent indications** , and delay
    other non-emergent communications until the morning

Specific Procedural Questions:

Pre-Procedure

(contact consult services for case-specific requirements, guidelines
below):

-   NPO @ MN prior to procedure if sedation is to be used (majority of
    cases)
-   Labs required morning of procedure:
    -   INR (\<1.5 for most procedures)
    -   Plts (>50K)
-   Anticoagulation
    -   Hold Lovenox for 12h prior to procedure
    -   Hold AM dose of SQH prior to procedure
    -   Search “SIR anticoagulation guidelines 2019” for hold times for
        other AC
-   Para/thora/LP: typically requires **prior failure** by floor team or
    procedure services. Please describe why initial procedure failed so
    that radiology can avoid that issue.
-   Inpatient biopsies for malignancy
    : due to schedule and resource availability, it is rare that this is
    approved as an inpatient.
    -   Consider placing outpatient consult for “adult image-guided
        procedures” team.
    -   The pt will get an outpatient slot, and if they happen to still
        be inpatient, they will receive the biopsy at that time
        regardless to prevent keeping patient hospitalized only for
        biopsy

Drain management

: Best to discuss directly with service that placed the drain

-   Flush with 10mL NS BID (flush into drain, then put back to gravity
    or accordian suction)
-   If drain output decreases, either:
    -   The drained area (e.g. abscess) is empty
    -   The drain is clogged/malfunctioning /malpositioned
-   Start with ensuring the drain is adequately flushed/flushing. If
    still no output, CT w/ IV contrast to re-evaluate area of the drain,
    then page 835-0770 (Body Procedures) for abscess drains or page
    835-5105
    (Vascular IR) for rec’s regarding PCNs, PTCs, or G-tubes.
    -   If an abscess drain is malfunctioning, first ensure proper
        suction/3-way direction. Next instill tPA into the catheter for
        2 hours. Epic order: “Alteplase (TPA) injection/infusion
        options” -> Percutaneous drainage -> 2mg or 4mg (20mL or 40mL,
        1mg/10mL concentration). Reach out to Body Procedures service
        (835-0770) with any questions.
    -   If drain is at an operative site, confirm drain tPA is
        acceptable by surgery team.
    -   If this doesn’t improve output in 48 hours, consider
        repositioning drain (VIR consult).
