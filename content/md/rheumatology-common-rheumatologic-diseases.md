Common Rheumatologic Diseases

Rheumatoid Arthritis – Greg Jackson

Background

-   Proliferation of synovial tissue, mediated by TNF, IL-1, IL-6
    leading to joint destruction
-   Chronic, inflammatory polyarthritis affecting the small joints of
    the hands, wrists, and feet
-   Pain and swelling of joints, typically symmetric MCP, wrists, MTP
    affected
-   Ulnar deviation, swan neck, boutonniere deformities are late
    manifestations of untreated disease
-   Morning stiffness lasting >1 hr suggests inflammatory arthritis like
    RA, but is not specific
-   C1-C2 instability: pts need evaluation with imaging prior to
    surgical procedure/intubation

Evaluation

-   Clinical diagnosis and positive RF, anti-CCP (as described in labs
    section above), though up to 30% patients have seronegative RA ,
    elevated ESR and CRP
-   CBC, CMP, HIV, Hepatitis B and C screening; Quantiferon Gold (for
    possible biologics)
-   Obtain hand films to assess for osteopenia & erosions

Management

-   The majority of joint damage occurs early in the disease so early
    treatment paramount
-   DMARDs: start with MTX; if inadequate response, add biologic such as
    TNF inhibitors
    -   Dosing
        : MTX 7.5-20 mg weekly; need to supplement with folic acid 1 mg
        daily
    -   Requires
        routine lab monitoring for bone marrow suppression, lung and
        liver toxicity
    -   Contraception
        must be used in women of childbearing age on MTX
-   Symptomatic/Flare treatment (no impact on disease progression):
    -   NSAIDs
        : high doses required for anti-inflammatory effects (ie
        ibuprofen 3200 mg/day or 1000 mg/day naproxen), usually treat
        for 2 wks to achieve maximum analgesic effect
    -   Prednisone
        5-10 mg/day for 2 weeks and then slow wean off or low-dose (5 mg
        or less)

Anti-Phospholipid Syndrome – Gautam Babu

Background

-   Development of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPLs) = a heterogenous
    group of autoantibodies, which interact with endothelial
    cells through binding of
    β
    2GPI receptor
-   APLs induce a procoagulant and proinflammatory
    endothelial phenotype, resulting in arterial, venous, or small
    vessel thromboembolic events and/or pregnancy losses

Presentation

-   Common features: DVTs, thrombocytopenia, and livedo reticularis
-   Arterial thromboses: renal, mesenteric, coronary and cerebral
    vasculature
-   Pulmonary embolism, CTEPH, nonbacterial vegetations (Libman-Sacks
    endocarditis)

Evaluation

-   Revised Sapporo classification criteria are used to diagnose
    patients with APS
-   At least one of the clinical criteria and one of the laboratory
    criteria are met:
    -   Vascular thrombosis (arterial, small vessel, or venous)
    -   Pregnancy morbidity
    -   LA (lupus anticoagulant) present, on 2 or more occasions at
        least 12 weeks apart
    -   aCL (anticardiolipin antibody) of IgG and/or IgM isotype in
        serum or plasma, present in medium or high titer, on two or more
        occasions, at least 12 weeks apart
    -   Anti-beta-2 glycoprotein-I antibody of IgG and/or IgM isotype in
        serum or plasma, present on two or more occasions, at least 12
        weeks apart  

Management

-   Mainstay is anticoagulation for treatment and secondary prevention
-   Do not use (ASA or AC) for primary thrombosis prevention
-   Acute thromboembolism: Heparin gtt with bridge to warfarin
-   Secondary thrombosis prevention, anticoagulation with warfarin is
    preferred
    -   Studies
        suggest that DOACs are less effective than warfarin
    -   Goal INR 2-3 regardless of whether arterial or venous
        thromboembolism present
-   ASA 81 mg + warfarin for pts w/arterial events and risks for ASCVD

Systemic Lupus Erythematous

– Greg Jackson

Presentation

-   Characterized by multisystem inflammation, precise etiology of
    disease unknown
-   Constitutional: fatigue, fevers, weight loss
-   Neurologic: cerebritis, myelitis, psychosis
-   Skin: malar rash, discoid rash, photosensitive rashes
-   Hematologic: leukopenia, anemia, thrombocytopenia
-   Pulmonary: pleuritis, pleural effusion, ILD
-   Cardiac: pericarditis/myocarditis (also due to underlying
    inflammatory condition have increased risk for coronary artery
    disease, similar to RA); Libman-Sacks endocarditis
-   Renal: nephritic/nephrotic syndrome
-   MSK: arthralgias/myalgias/arthritis

Evaluation

-   See section on rheumatology labs for specific
    sensitivity/specificity of tests
-   SLICC criteria not initially developed to diagnose SLE but often
    used:  need >/= 4/17 of SLICC criteria with >/=1 clinical and >/= 1
    immunologic

Management

-   Hydroxychloroquine mainstay of treatment, 200-400 mg/day, dose 5
    mg/kg/day for long term to decrease risk of retinal toxicity
    -   Monitor
        for retinal toxicity with yearly retinal exam
-   Glucocorticoids for flares (Similar dosing to RA)
    -   Usually
        started with hydroxychloroquine and tapered once
        hydroxychloroquine has taken effect for symptom control
-   Other immunosuppressive medications (MTX, MMF, AZA, RTX) used with
    rheumatology consultation: MMF, cyclophosphamide used in SLE with
    renal involvement

Catastrophic Anti-phospholipid Syndrome (CAPS) – Gautam Babu

Background

-   Occurs in a small subset of patients with APS
-   Rapid development of thromboses in multiple small blood vessels in
    various organs resulting in multiorgan failure

Presentation

-   Similar presentation to APS, but multiple organs are involved in a
    short period of time
-   Renal (hypertension, proteinuria, hematuria, acute renal failure),
    Pulmonary (ARDS, PE), Central Nervous System (encephalopathy,
    stroke, cerebral venous thrombosis), Cardiac (coronary thrombosis),
    and Cutaneous (livedo reticularis, acrocyanosis, purpura,
    ecchymosis, splinter hemorrhages, and necrosis resulting in
    ulceration)
-   Pts can develop systemic inflammatory response syndrome 2/2
    extensive tissue damage  

Evaluation

-   Exclude other causes of small vessel occlusion: HIT, DIC or TMA
-   Definite
    diagnosis of CAPS is made when all four diagnostic criteria are
    present
-   Diagnosis is **probable** when a combination of these criteria is
    present
    -   Evidence
        of involvement of three or more organs, systems, and/or tissues
    -   Development
        of manifestations simultaneously or in less than a week
    -   Confirmation
        by histopathology of small vessel occlusion in at least one
        organ or tissue
    -   Laboratory
        confirmation of the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies:
-   Lupus anticoagulant, anticardiolipin antibodies, and/or
    anti-beta2-glycoprotein I

Management

-   Anticoagulation
    : Heparin gtt acutely
-   Transition
    to warfarin:
    If hemodynamically stable; no
    bleeding or
    recurrent thromboses
-   Immunosuppression: methylprednisolone 0.5 to 1 g intravenously daily
    for 3 days, subsequently followed by oral prednisone therapy at 1
    mg/kg/day
-   Severe cases may require PLEX +/- IVIG
-   Refractory CAPS may require rituximab or eculizumab

Sarcoidosis – Jared Freitas

Background

-   Multisystem
    disordered defined by forming noncaseating granulomas in different
    tissues
-   Cardiac
    and neuro manifestations can be isolated

Presentation

-   Constitutional
    symptoms: fatigue, night sweats, weight loss, fevers, arthralgias,
    myalgias
-   Pulmonary
    symptoms (most common): dyspnea, cough, and wheezing
-   Extrapulmonary
    manifestations:
    -   Cutaneous
        -   Highly variable, but present in 25% of patients
        -   Papules, macules, plaques that can be isolated or in groups,
            commonly involving neck, upper back, extremities; in African
            Americans can leave scars and depigmented areas
        -   Lupus pernio: indurated, violaceous bumps on nose, lips,
            cheeks, ears
        -   Erythema nodosum
-   Neuro
    -   Affects 5-10% pts; involving any part of CNS or PNS, causing CN,
        hypothalamic, seizures, myelopathy or radiculopathy,
        hydrocephalus, aseptic meningitis
-   Cardiac
    -   Granulomas can affect pericardium, myocardium and endocardium
        resulting in valvular disorders, conduction system and
        cardiomyopathy
-   Liver/Spleen
    -   Granulomas in liver and spleen can lead to elevated LFTs,
        cirrhosis, anemia, leukopenia and thrombocytopenia (splenic
        sequestration)
-   Ocular
    -   Photophobia, red eye, pain, blurry vision
    -   Pts need eye exams to look for ocular involvement: uveitis
        (anterior and posterior), secondary glaucoma, retinal
        vasculitis, keratoconjunctivitis

Work Up

-   Requires
    combination of clinical presentation, radiographic manifestations,
    exclusion of other similarly presenting diseases, and noncaseating
    granulomas on pathology
-   CXR: hilar and mediastinal lymphadenopathy
    ±
    pulmonary infiltrates
-   High-Resolution Chest CT
    -   Lymphadenopathy (bilateral and symmetric), with micro or
        macronodules, fibrotic changes (reticular opacities, traction
        bronchiectasis, volume loss)
-   PFTs
    -   Typical findings: most sensitive is reduced DLCO, followed by
        reduced TLC, and then reduced VC (need to do full PFTs not just
        spirometry)
-   Labs:
    -   CBC w/ diff, CMP, and urinalysis
    -   ACE level is of limited clinical use
    -   Testing for TB: Quant-Gold
-   Biopsy
    -   Important to rule out mimics. The differential for “noncaseating
        granulomas” is extensive, including lymphoma and fungal
        infections
    -   Not required for pts w/ asymptomatic bilateral hilar adenopathy
        or **Lofgren syndrome** (fever, erythema nodosum, arthralgias,
        and bilateral hilar LAD)
    -   Target accessible lesions, like skin lesions or lymph nodes. May
        need bronchoscopy

Management

-   Most
    pts do not require therapy
    -   Monitor symptoms, CXR, PFTs at 3-6 month intervals
-   Indications for treatment
    : progressive disease or severe disease at presentation
-   Mainstay of treatment is oral steroids:
    -   Dosing usually 0.3-0.6 mg/kg daily for 4-6 weeks
    -   If only symptoms is cough, could consider inhaled
        glucocorticoids
-   If unresponsive or unable to tolerate steroids may require
    alternative agents (MTX, AZA)
