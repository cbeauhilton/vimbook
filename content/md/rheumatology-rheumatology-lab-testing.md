# Rheumatology Lab Testing
 
Rheumatology Lab Testing – Ben Boone

-   Rheumatologic labs must be interpreted in the context of the
    clinical situation
-   It is challenging to interpret positive/abnormal labs with low
    pretest probability
-   Sensitivities and specificities referenced below refer to scenarios
    with moderate-to-high probability clinical situations

Rheumatoid Factor (RF)

-   A group of antibodies targeted against the Fc region of IgG
-   When positive in RA patients, called “seropositive RA” (typically
    more symptomatic)
-   A higher RF level is more specific for RA
-   70 - 80% sensitive for RA, but not very specific
    -   Present in 5-15% of healthy people
    -   Commonly positive in Sjogren’s, Mixed Connective Tissue Disease
        (MCTD), Mixed Cryoglobulinemia, SLE, and rarely inflammatory
        myopathies
    -   Can be positive some infectious diseases (i.e. malaria, hep B/C,
        rubella)
    -   Often positive in RA patients before Anti-CCP and even before
        symptoms/diagnosis
    -   Can be used as a surrogate when mixed cryoglobulinemia is
        suspected, since cryoglobulins can take up to a week to result
        and RF results in \<48 hour  

Anti-cyclic Citrullinated Peptides (Anti-CCP)

-   Very specific for RA (>95%); only 70% sensitive for RA
-   When positive in RA patients, called “seropositive RA” (typically
    more symptomatic)
-   A high titer is associated with more aggressive disease in RA

Anti-nuclear Antibodies (ANA)

-   Don't order for nonspecific symptoms – High Value Rheumatology Care
    Recommendation
-   Should always be ordered with the reflex survey **(ANA w/ Rfx
    ENA/DNA)**
-   Reported as both a titer and a pattern
    -   Titer
        -   At VUMC, 1:80 is considered “positive”; however, a higher
            titer is more specific (albeit less sensitive) for
            ANA-associated rheumatologic disease
        -   \~30% of the general population has a “positive” ANA at
            1:40, whereas only \~1% of people have a true ANA-associated
            rheumatologic disease
    -   Pattern
        (three clinically significant ones)
        -   Smooth/homogenous – associated with Anti-dsDNA and
            Anti-histone antibodies
        -   Speckled – associated with Anti-RNP, Anti-Smith,
            Anti-SSA/Ro, Anti-SSB/La
        -   Nucleolar – associated with Anti-Scl-70
-   If ANA is
    ≥
    1:80 the following studies will be sent:
    -   Anti-dsDNA (Quantitative and Qualitative)
        -   Classical teaching is
            anti-dsDNA antibodies are specific for SLE. However, this
            depends on lab methodology; VUMC uses ELISA assay (less
            specific)
        -   In some pts, dsDNA varies with disease activity
        -   If dsDNA is positive, there is an increased risk of renal
            lupus
    -   Positive
        if <u>\></u> 25 IU/mL \~70% sensitive and specific for SLE

<!-- -->

-   -   Anti-SSA/Ro (Qualitative)
        -   Non-specific; \~70% sensitive for Sjogren’s; present in
            \~30% of SLE and MCTD pts
        -   Present in \~20% of RA and idiopathic inflammatory myopathy
            pts
        -   Maternal positivity for SSA is associated with congenital
            heart block in infants
    -   Anti-SSB/La (Qualitative)

<!-- -->

-   Similar profile to Anti-SSA/Ro but less common
-   \~50% of Sjogren’s and \~20% of SLE/MCTD pts
-   Very rare to have Anti-SSB w/o Anti-SSA in a pt with true Sjogren’s
    disease
    -   Anti-Scl-70 (Qualitative)
        -   Very specific for systemic sclerosis (>99%); 20-60%
            sensitive for systemic sclerosis
        -   \~70% sensitive for diffuse cutaneous systemic sclerosis
        -   Only \~10% sensitive for CREST syndrome
    -   Anti-Smith (Qualitative)
-   Very specific >99% for SLE; but only \~20% sensitive for SLE
    -   Anti-RNP (Qualitative)
-   Required for MCTD diagnosis; present in \~40% of SLE; rarely in
    systemic sclerosis

Other notable ANAs

-   Anti-histone: Associated w/drug-induced lupus (VUMC order: **Histone
    IgG-ARUP** )
-   Anti-centromere: Seen in limited scleroderma (CREST syndrome)
-   Anti-neutrophil Cytoplasmic Antibodies (ANCA)
    -   Qualitative: p-ANCA, c-ANCA, negative, or indeterminate
    -   Quantitative titers: anti-proteinase 3 (PR3),
        anti-myeloperoxidase (MPO) IgG antibodies

C3 and C4

-   Complement
    levels should be checked in any pt in whom you suspect active SLE
-   Complement may also be low in diseases that decreases the liver’s
    synthetic function
-   ↓
    C3
    /C4 in diseases that form immune complexes, activating the classic
    complement pathway: mixed cryoglobulinemia, Sjogren’s, MPGN, and
    antiphospholipid syndrome

C-reactive Protein (CRP) and Erythrocyte Sedimentation Rate (ESR)

-   -   Both tests are non-specific markers of inflammation
    -   Should be ordered alongside other rheumatology labs to
        corroborate disease activity

-   CRP
    measures a specific protein made by the liver that activates the
    complement pathway
    -   CRP is IL-6 dependent
    -   ↓
        IL-6 (pts on tocilizumab or tofacitinib) results in
        ↓
        CRP regardless of disease activity

-   ESR is the rate that RBCS settle in a standardized tube in one hour
    -   Fibrinogen is the primary driver of the ESR
    -   The positive fibrinogen binds to the negatively-charged RBCs,
        allowing them to settle faster in the tube as RBCs no longer
        repel each other (both negatively charged)
    -   Both Low fibrinogen (DIC or HLH) and anemia falsely lower the
        ESR

Creatinine Kinase (CK)

-   CK can be elevated by exercise, rhabdomyolysis, endocrinopathy,
    cardiac disease, renal disease, malignancy, medication effect,
    neuromuscular disease, connective tissue disease
    -   Vigorous exercise can elevate CK up to 30-times the upper limit
        of normal
-   CK can be elevated in asymptomatic pts (should be rechecked in 1 wk
    to ensure resolution)
-   Elevated
    CK in pts with objective proximal muscle weakness can direct the
    differential diagnosis to inflammatory myopathies (dermatomyositis,
    inclusion body myositis, polymyositis, and immune-mediated
    necrotizing myopathy)
    -   Notably, CK is normal in polymyalgia rheumatica

Cryoglobulin Evaluation

-   Clinical context drives interpretation of the test:
    -   The presence of detectable cryoglobulins
        ≠
        cryoglobulinemic vasculitis
-   Reported
    as qualitative (positive or negative) and quantitative (percentage =
    “cryocrit”)
    -   This test is highly prone to collection error
    -   To perform this test, you need 6 full red-top tubes, kept
        between 37-39°C from the moment they are collected. This is
        accomplished using a thermos with a thermometer aka the “Cryo
        Kit”. At VUMC, this kit can be found in the immunopathology lab
        on the 4th floor. Place water at 39°C in the kit, then collect
        the blood at bedside with a nurse, placing each labeled tube
        directly into the water. Once all 6 tubes are collected, take
        the Cryo Kit back to the lab. If the temperature is less than
        37°C, the lab won’t accept it
-   Essential Cryoglobulinemia (rare \~ 10%): cryoglobulinemia w/o
    associated disease
-   Cryoglobulinemic
    vasculitis: small vessel vasculitis with a highly variable
    presentation
    -   Arthralgias, peripheral neuropathy and renal disease (usually
        MPGN) are common
    -   Skin involvement (purpura and erythematous macules, usually in
        colder areas of the body like the lower extremities)
-   Type
    I Cryoglobulins
    -   Monoclonal immunoglobulins (Igs); usually IgG or IgM; rarely IgA
        or light chains
    -   Classically associated with digital ischemia, skin necrosis, and
        livedo reticularis
    -   Associated with Waldenström macroglobulinemia, multiple myeloma,
        MGUS, and CLL
-   Mixed Cryoglobulins (these do not produce a single monoclonal
    antibody like Type I)
    -   Type II
        -   A mixture of a monoclonal Ig (IgG, IgM, or IgA) combined
            with polyclonal Igs
        -   Associated with chronic viral infections HCV (most common),
            HBV, and HIV
        -   Less commonly seen in autoimmune diseases like SLE and
            Sjogren’s
    -   Type III
        -   A mixture of polyclonal IgG and polyclonal IgM
        -   Associated with the reverse profile of Type II; most
            commonly with autoimmune diseases; less commonly with
            infections

Extended Myositis Panel

-   Can be sent when suspecting various forms of myositis such as
    dermatomyositis, polymyositis, anti-synthetase syndrome, etc.
-   Ordered as “ **Myositis extended Pnl-ARUP** ”
    -   Includes 19 separate antibodies with a summary interpretation
        provided at the end
-   P155 (TIF1-gamma) and P140 (NXP-2) antibodies are particularly
    associated with malignancy in pts > 30 y/o (ensure age-appropriate
    cancer screening)
    -   PET/CT and pelvic U/S in female patients should be pursued to
        search for malignancy
